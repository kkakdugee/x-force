Heavy quark radiation in an anisotropic hot QCD medium,,"[{'name': 'Jai Prakash'}, {'name': 'Vinod Chandra'}, {'name': 'Santosh K. Das'}]",,2023-06-13T17:59:05Z,"The impact of momentum anisotropy on the heavy quarks (HQs) dynamics has been
investigated in a hot QCD medium while considering both collisional and
radiative processes within the ambit of the Fokker-Planck approach. The
relative orientation of the HQs motion (momentum vector) with respect to the
direction of anisotropy is responsible for the character of transport
coefficients. Therefore, the drag and diffusion coefficients of the HQs are
decomposed, respectively, into two and four components by considering a general
tensor basis. Each component of the drag and diffusion coefficient of the HQs
has been analyzed in detail. It is observed that the anisotropy has a
significant impact on the transport coefficients of the HQ for both the
collisional and the radiational processes. The nuclear suppression factor,

resolutions less than 30 ps will play a critical role in future collider
experiments, and LGADs have been demonstrated to provide the required time
resolution and radiation tolerance for many such applications. The FCFD has a
specially designed discriminator that is robust against amplitude variations of
the signal from the LGAD that normally requires an additional correction step
when using a traditional leading edge discriminator based measurement. The
application of the CFD directly in the ASIC promises to be more reliable and
reduces the complication of timing detectors during their operation. We will
present a summary of the measured performance of the FCFD for input signals
generated by internal charge injection, LGAD signals from an infrared laser,
and LGAD signals from minimum-ionizing particles. The mean time response for a
wide range of LGAD signal amplitudes has been measured to vary no more than 15
ps, orders of magnitude more stable than an uncorrected leading edge
discriminator based measurement, and effectively removes the need for any

abundant energy, the energy requirements for retaining water and capturing
hydrogen atoms to build biomass are not excessive, defenses against sulfuric
acid are conceivable and have terrestrial precedent, and the speculative
possibility that life uses concentrated sulfuric acid as a solvent instead of
water remains. Metals are likely to be available in limited supply, and the
radiation environment is benign. The clouds can support a biomass that could
readily be detectable by future astrobiology-focused space missions from its

Upper Limit on Correlated Current Variations in the Crab Pulsar,,[{'name': 'M. Vivekanand'}],,2023-06-10T13:41:10Z,"The high energy emission of rotation powered pulsars is supposed to be

an MHD kink instability in a single twisted magnetic flux tube. An initial
helical current sheet fragments in a turbulent way into smaller-scale sheets,
similarly to a nanoflare storm. As the loop expands in the radial direction
during the relaxation process, an unstable loop can disrupt nearby stable loops
and trigger an MHD avalanche. Exploratory investigations have been conducted in
previous works with relatively simplified loop configurations. Here, we address
a more realistic environment that comprehensively accounts for most of the
physical effects involved in a stratified atmosphere, typical of an active
region. The question is whether the avalanche process will be triggered, with
what timescales, and how it will develop, as compared with the original,
simpler approach. Three-dimensional MHD simulations describe the interaction of
magnetic flux tubes, which have a stratified atmosphere, including
chromospheric layers, the thin transition region to the corona, and the related
transition from high-beta to low-beta regions. The model also includes the
effects of thermal conduction and of optically thin radiation. Our simulations
address the case where one flux tube among a few is twisted at the footpoints
faster than its neighbours. We show that this flux tube becomes kink unstable
first, in conditions in agreement with those predicted by analytical models. It
rapidly involves nearby stable tubes, instigating significant magnetic
reconnection and dissipation of energy as heat. The heating determines the
development of chromospheric evaporation, while the temperature rises up to
about 10 MK, close to microflares observations. This work confirms that
avalanches are a viable mechanism for the storing and release of magnetic
energy in plasma confined in closed coronal loops, as a result of photospheric

dynamics of various turbulent flows. In this study, we perform a resolvent
analysis of a compressible turbulent jet, where the optimisation domain of the
response modes is located in the acoustic field, excluding the hydrodynamic
region, in order to promote acoustically efficient modes. We examine the
properties of the acoustic resolvent and assess its potential for jet-noise
modelling, focusing on the subsonic regime. We compare resolvent modes with
SPOD modes educed from LES data. Resolvent forcing modes, consistent with
previous studies, are found to contain supersonic waves associated with Mach
wave radiation in the response modes. This differs from the standard resolvent
in which hydrodynamic instabilities dominate. Acoustic resolvent response modes
generally have better alignment with acoustic SPOD modes than standard
resolvent response modes. For the optimal mode, the angle of the acoustic beam
is close to that found in SPOD modes for moderate frequencies. However, there
is no significant separation between the singular values of the leading and
sub-optimal modes. Some suboptimal modes are furthermore shown to contain
irrelevant structure for jet noise. Thus, even though it contains essential
acoustic features absent from the standard resolvent approach, the SVD of the
acoustic resolvent alone is insufficient to educe a low-rank model for jet
noise. But because it identifies the prevailing mechanisms of jet noise, it
provides valuable guidelines in the search of a forcing model (Karban

The BHL-BCL crossover: from nonlinear to linear quantum amplification,,"[{'name': 'Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova'}, {'name': 'Fernando Sols'}]",,2023-06-08T18:00:02Z,"The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking
radiation in the presence of a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity.
Its clear observation still remains a major challenge in the analogue gravity
field. In a flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite
supersonic region, where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is
resonantly excited by any static perturbation. Thus, any experimental attempt
to produce a BHL will deal with the presence of a BCL background, as already
observed in experiments. Here, we perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL
crossover using an idealized model where both phenomena can be unambiguously
isolated. By drawing an analogy with an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three
main regimes according to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and
classical stimulation: quantum BHL, classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite
general scaling arguments, the nonlinear amplification of quantum fluctuations
until saturation is identified as the most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A
classical BHL behaves instead as a linear quantum amplifier, where the output
is proportional to the input. Finally, the BCL regime also acts as a linear
quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially smaller as compared to a
classical BHL. The results of this work not only are of interest for analogue
gravity, where they help to distinguish unambiguously each phenomenon and to
design experimental schemes for a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they
also open the prospect of finding applications of analogue concepts in quantum

Given the importance of the $T_e$ distribution in the corona for exploring the

method (in angle) is used to approximate the uncollided components and a
low-resolution method is used to approximate the the collided component. After
each time step, the kinetic distribution is reinitialized to be entirely
uncollided. For this analysis, we consider a mono-energetic problem on a
periodic domains, with constant material cross-sections of arbitrary size. To
focus the analysis, we assume the uncollided equation is solved exactly and the
collided part is approximated in angle via a spherical harmonic expansion

estimates of the form $C(\varepsilon,\sigma,\Delta t)N^{-s}$ where $s\geq 1$

An octupolar test of general relativity,,[{'name': 'Parthapratim Mahapatra'}],,2023-06-07T18:09:37Z,"Compact binaries with unequal masses and whose orbits are not aligned with
the observer's line of sight are excellent probes of gravitational radiation
beyond the quadrupole approximation. Among the compact binaries observed so
far, strong evidence of octupolar modes is seen in GW190412 and GW190814, two
binary black holes observed during the first half of the third observing run of
LIGO/Virgo observatories. These two events, therefore, provide a unique
opportunity to test the consistency of the octupolar modes with the predictions
of general relativity (GR). In the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to GR, the
gravitational-wave phasing has known dependencies on different radiative
multipole moments, including the mass octupole. This permits the use of
publicly released posteriors of the PN phase deformation parameters for placing
constraints on the deformations to the different PN components of the radiative
mass octupole denoted by $\delta \mu_{3n}$. Combining the posteriors on $\delta
\mu_{3n}$ from these two events, we deduce a joint bound (at 90% credibility)

these, the measurement of $\delta \mu_{33}$ for the first time confirms the
well-known octupolar tail contribution, a novel nonlinear effect due to the

idealistic modelling, through the hypotheses of spherical symmetry and
hydrostatic equilibrium, are more and more being questioned. Along these lines,
the soft X-ray emission detected in tens of clusters with ROSAT was found to be
higher than what expected from the idealistic hot gas modelling, pointing to
our incomplete understanding of these objects. Aims. Given that cluster
environments are at the interface between the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM),
warm circum-galactic medium (WCGM) and warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we
aim to explore the relative soft X-ray emission of different gas phases in
circum-cluster environments. Method. By using the most massive halos in
IllustrisTNG at z=0, we have predicted the hydrodynamical properties of the gas
from cluster centers to their outskirts (5 R200), and modelled their X-ray
radiation for various plasma phases. Results. First, we found that the radial
profile of temperature, density, metallicity and clumpiness of the ICM are in
good agreement with recent X-ray observations of clusters. Secondly, we have
developed a method to predict the radial profile of soft X-ray emission in
different bands, the column density of ions and the X-ray absorption lines (O
VIII, O VII, Ne IX, and Ne IX) of warm-hot gas inside and around clusters.
Conclusion. The warm gas (in the form of both WCGM and WHIM gas) is a strong
emitter in soft X-ray bands, and is qualitatively consistent with the
observational measurements. Our results suggest that the cluster soft excess is
induced by the thermal emission of warm gas in the circum-cluster environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04694v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy due to insufficient heating by the
radiation and the gas is in the so-called `cold' regime. Only magnetic or
radiation forces can then lead to outflow, but it is unclear at what

impact of outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) on their host

diagnostics have measured much higher densities than those from commonly used
techniques, and consequently find modest outflow masses and kinetic powers.
Furthermore, outflow ionisation mechanisms - which are often used to probe
acceleration mechanisms - are also uncertain. To address these issues, we have
analysed archival HST/STIS spectra of the inner regions (r<160pc) of the nearby
prototypical Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151, which show evidence of
warm-ionised outflows driven by the central AGN. We derive high electron

is evidence for shock-ionisation and/or radiation-bounded AGN-photoionisation
along the radio axis in NGC 4151. We also note that the outflow extents are
similar to those of the radio structures, consistent with acceleration by
jet-induced shocks. Taken together, our investigation demonstrates the

wind. This work seeks to determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of
the material ejected through radiation-driven winds and its significance for
Galactic abundances. It also reports on the evolution of pysical quantities
during the wind phase that could help constrain the mass-radius relation in
neutron stars. A non-relativistic radiative wind model was implemented and
linked, through a new technique, to a series of XRB hydrodynamic simulations,
that include over 300 isotopes. This allows us to construct a quasi-stationary
time evolution of the wind during the XRB. The simulations resulted in the
first realistic quantification of mass-loss for each isotope synthesized in the
XRB. The total mass ejected by the wind was about $6\times10^{19}g$, the
average ejected mass per unit time represents 2.6% of the accretion rate, with
0.1% of the envelope mass ejected per burst and ~90% of the ejecta composed by
$^{60}$Ni, $^{64}$Zn, $^{68}$Ge and $^{58}$Ni. The ejected material also
contained a small fraction ($10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) of some light p-nuclei, but not
enough to account for their Galactic abundances. Additionally, the observable
magnitudes during the wind phase showed remarkable correlations, some of which
involve wind parameters like energy and mass outflows, that are determined by
the conditions at the base of the wind envelope. These correlations could be

  It was found that flare-driven changes to chemical composition and

stars and hot dust are spatially distinct from one another, leading to
order-of-magnitude variations in the PAH equivalent width and the ratio of PAH

On the other hand, bifacial TPV conversion, operating in the far-field regime,

controlling the temporal features of the electron pulses. One promising
suggestion is the nano-selective driving of quantum optics with
multi-electrons, which can occur if laser-structured consecutive electrons are
bunched within the decoherence time of the quantum system. Compressing electron
pulses with terahertz (THz) radiation formed in optical nonlinear crystals is
an attractive methodology to generate the rapidly varying electric fields
necessary for electron compression, with an inherent temporal locking to
laser-triggered electrons. Sub-THz are especially appealing as they can
compress longer (picosecond-) pulses, however, the generation of such low
frequencies is inefficient and their focusability is fundamentally limited by
diffraction. This work proposes electron-pulse compression with sub-THz fields
directly in the vicinity of their dipolar origin, thereby avoiding their
mediation through radiation. We analyze the merits of such nearfields for

doses is inherently uncertain. A current methodological challenge in radiation
epidemiology is thus to be able to account for dose uncertainty in risk

influential input parameters implied in dose estimation, before modelling and
accounting for their related uncertainty in radiation-induced health risks

radiative transfer calculations are a fundamental tool for a detailed spectral
analysis in stellar atmospheres, but require vast amounts of computer power.
This prevents their broader application. Aims. We undertake a first exploration
of the use of 3D irregular grids in stellar atmospheres. In particular, we aim
to test whether irregular grids can be used to speed up the 3D NLTE problem, in
the same way as depth optimisation can lead to faster running times in 1D.
Methods. We created irregular grids based on 3D Voronoi diagrams, sampling
different distributions from a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic Bifrost
simulation. We developed a method for solving radiation on the 3D irregular
grid and implemented a simple NLTE solver using $\Lambda$-iteration and
statistical equilibrium. We applied this to a simplified hydrogen-like atom and
studied the convergence properties and accuracy of the irregular grid methods.
For reference, we compared them to a standard short-characteristics solver on a
regular grid. Results. We find that our method for radiation in irregular grids
gives similar results to those from regular grids, and that it is possible to
obtain nearly the same results with about ten times fewer points in the
irregular grid for the continuum intensity in local thermodynamical
equilibrium. We find that the irregular grid can give good results for the NLTE
problem, but it takes four times longer per iteration than the regular grid,
and it converges in about the same number of iterations. This makes it
particularly inefficient. Our formulation therefore does not lead to an
improvement. We also find that the design of the irregular grid is crucial for
accurate results, and find it non-trivial to design an irregular grid that can
work well across a wide range of heights.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01041v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

Photomultipliers exposed to this level of radiation have shown a strong
increase of dark count rate and radiation damage effects that also impact their

illustrate an innovative and cost-effective solution to mitigate the impact of
radiation damage on the timing performance of the detector, by integrating
small thermo-electric coolers (TECs) on the back of the SiPM package. This
additional feature, fully integrated as part of the SiPM array, enables a
further decrease in operating temperature down to about $-45^{\circ}$C. This
leads to a reduction by a factor of about two in the dark count rate without
requiring additional power budget, since the power required by the TEC is
almost entirely offset by a decrease in the power required for the SiPM
operation due to leakage current. In addition, the operation of the TECs with
reversed polarity during technical stops of the accelerator can raise the
temperature of the SiPMs up to 60$^{\circ}$C (about 50$^{\circ}$C higher than

in the presence of quintessence or phantom-like scalar fields. Our treatment is
based on the principles of general relativity up to virialization. We have
chosen a spherical patch that starts to collapse gravitationally as it happens
in top-hat collapse. It is seen that although the dark matter sector collapses
the dark energy sector does keep a profile that is almost similar to the dark
energy profile for the background expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) universe for suitable model parameters. It is observed that in order to
formulate the problem in the general relativistic setting one has to abandon
the idea of a closed FLRW isolated collapsing patch. General relativity
requires an external generalized Vaidya spacetime to be matched with the
internal spherical patch whose dynamics is guided by the FLRW metric. It is
shown that almost all collapses are accompanied by some flux of matter and
radiation in the generalized Vaidya spacetime. Some of the spherical regions of
the universe are seen not to collapse but expand eternally, producing void-like
structures. Whether a spherical region will collapse or expand depends upon the
initial values of the system and other model parameters. As this work shows
that collapsing structures must emit some form of radiation, this may be taken

couples gas to stellar radiation fields, allowing radiation feedback to
influence gas fragmentation and thus the stellar initial mass function (IMF).
Variations in dust abundance therefore provide a potential avenue by which
variation in galaxy metallicity might affect the IMF. In this paper we present
a series of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which we vary the
metallicity and thus the dust abundance from 1% of Solar to 3$\times$ Solar,
spanning the range from the lowest metallicity dwarfs to the most metal-rich
early-type galaxies found in the local Universe. We design the simulations to
keep all dimensionless parameters constant so that the interaction between
feedback and star-forming environments of varying surface density and
metallicity is the only factor capable of breaking the symmetry between the
simulations and modifying the IMF, allowing us to cleanly isolate and
understand the effects of each environmental parameter. We find that at a fixed
surface density more metal-rich clouds tend to form a slightly more
bottom-heavy IMF than metal-poor ones, primarily because in metal-poor gas
radiation feedback is able to propagate further, heating somewhat larger
volumes of gas. However, shifts in IMF with metallicity at a fixed surface
density are much smaller than shifts with surface density at fixed metallicity;
metallicity-induced IMF variations are too small to explain the variations in
mass-to-light ratio reported in galaxies of different mass and metallicity. We,
therefore, conclude that metallicity variations are much less important than
variations in surface density in driving changes in the IMF and that the latter

suggested that axion insulators may be capable of detecting dark-matter

fundamental theoretical interest, designing a photonic AXI offers the potential
to enable the development of magnetically-tunable photonic switch devices
through the manipulation of the axionic modes and their chiral propagation
using external magnetic fields. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we
propose a novel approach to induce axionic band topology in gyrotropic 3D Weyl
photonic crystals gapped by supercell modulation. To quantize an axionic angle,
we create domain-walls across inversion-symmetric photonic crystals,
incorporating a phase-obstruction in the supercell modulation of their
dielectric elements. This allows us to bind chiral channels on
inversion-related hinges, ultimately leading to the realization of an axionic
chiral channel of light. Moreover, by controlling the material gyrotropic
response, we demonstrate a physically accessible way of manipulating the
axionic modes through a small external magnetic bias, which provides an
effective topological switch between different 1D chiral photonic fiber
configurations. Remarkably, the unidirectional axionic hinge states supported
by the photonic axion insulator are buried in a fully connected 3D dielectric
structure, thereby being protected from radiation through the electromagnetic

selecting the transmitting antenna from an antenna array whose radiation

error being of the same magnitude as without noise. However, limiting the
precision of measurement data by applying Gaussian noise hurts the obtainable

high-quality sCT to facilitate radiation treatment planning. MC-DDPM implements
diffusion processes with a shifted-window transformer network to generate sCT

With an optimally trained Swin-Vnet, the reverse diffusion process was used to

radiation. For a long time, it has been believed that these systems cannot
descend from cataclysmic variables (CVs), at least not in large numbers,
because the initial conditions need to be fine-tuned and, even worse, the
resulting surface hydrogen abundance would be high enough to be detected which
contradicts a defining feature of AM CVn binaries.
  Aims. Here we show that both claimed weaknesses of the CV formation channel

assumptions for magnetic braking.
  Methods. We performed binary evolution simulations with the MESA code for
different combinations of post-common-envelope white dwarf and companion masses
as well as orbital periods assuming strong magnetic braking.
  Results. We found that AM CVn binaries with extremely-low surface hydrogen
abundances are one natural outcome of CV evolution if the donor star has
developed a non-negligible helium core prior to the onset of mass transfer. In
this case, after hydrogen envelope exhaustion during CV evolution, the donor
becomes degenerate and its surface hydrogen abundance substantially drops and
becomes undetectable. Our simulations also show that the CV formation channel
is able to explain the observed AM CVn binaries with very low mass and bloated
donor stars (Gaia14aae and ZTF J1637+49) which has not been demonstrated for

recent Planck data for suitable values of the parameters. After the inflation
ends, the scalar field starts to decay to radiation with a constant decay
width. For our considered scalar potential and the GB coupling function, the
model results to an analytic power law solution of the Hubble parameter and a
logarithmic solution of the scalar field during the reheating era, where the
exponent of the Hubble parameter determines the effective EoS parameter
($w_\mathrm{eff}$) during the same. The stability of such reheating dynamics is
examined by dynamical analysis which ensures that $w_\mathrm{eff}$ can go
beyond unity and reach up-to the maximum value of $\mathrm{max}(w_\mathrm{eff})
= 1.56$. The scenario with $w_\mathrm{eff} > 1$ proves to be purely due to the
presence of the GB coupling function, which in turn may have important
consequences on enhancing the primordial gravitational waves' amplitude
observed today. The inflationary e-fold number gets further constrained by the
input of the reheating stage. We finally construct the complete forms of scalar
potential ($V(\phi)$) and the GB coupling ($\xi(\phi)$) function that smoothly
transits from inflation to reheating, and numerically solve the Hubble
parameter and the scalar field for such complete forms of $V(\phi)$ and
$\xi(\phi)$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19110v1,"[{'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

"Implications of time-dependent molecular chemistry in metal-poor dwarf
  stars",,"[{'name': 'S. A. Deshmukh'}, {'name': 'H. -G. Ludwig'}]",,2023-05-30T08:49:33Z,"Binary molecules such as CO, OH, CH, CN, and C$_2$ are often used as
abundance indicators in stars. These species are usually assumed to be formed
in chemical equilibrium. The time-dependent effects of hydrodynamics can affect
the formation and dissociation of these species and may lead to deviations from
chemical equilibrium. We aim to model departures from chemical equilibrium in
dwarf stellar atmospheres by considering time-dependent chemical kinetics
alongside hydrodynamics and radiation transfer. We examine the effects of a
decreasing metallicity and an altered C/O ratio on the chemistry when compared
to the equilibrium state. We used the radiation-(magneto)hydrodynamics code
CO5BOLD, and its own chemical solver to solve for the chemistry of 15 species
and 83 reactions. The species were treated as passive tracers and were advected
by the velocity field. The steady-state chemistry was also computed to isolate
the effects of hydrodynamics.
  In most of the photospheres in the models we present, the mean deviations are
smaller than $0.2$ dex, and they generally appear above $\log{\tau} = -2$. The
deviations increase with height because the chemical timescales become longer
with decreasing density and temperature. A reduced metallicity similarly
results in longer chemical timescales and in a reduction in yield that is
proportional to the drop in metallicity; a decrease by a factor $100$ in
metallicity loosely corresponds to an increase by factor $100$ in chemical
timescales. As both CH and OH are formed along reaction pathways to CO, the C/O
ratio means that the more abundant element gives faster timescales to the
constituent molecular species. Overall, the carbon enhancement phenomenon seen
in very metal-poor stars is not a result of an improper treatment of molecular
chemistry for stars up to a metallicity as low as [Fe/H] = $-3.0$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18854v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

important effect on electronic and telecommunication devices. Thus, the effect

of interference wave on slot antennas. The first method is a classic technique
based on Maxwell's equations that studied the impact of electromagnetic waves
on slot antennas by using of the radiation integrals. In the second method, the
slots, by using the Babinets principle are modeled with the linear antenna.
Then, using linear antenna circuit and then, the equivalent circuit antennas at
the receiver mode is used. Eventually, the effect of interfering waves, by
calculating the voltage induced in the antenna port, is investigated.
Simulation results are given to verify the usefulness of the two introduced

may also accrete significant amounts of matter. To study the dynamics of such a

dynamics of magnetized plasma. Here we present the first relativistic
calculation simulating two equal-mass, non-spinning black holes as they
inspiral from an initial separation of $20M$ ($G=c=1$) almost to merger,
$\simeq 9M$, while accreting gas from a surrounding disk, where $M$ is the
total binary mass. We find that the accretion rate $\dot M$ onto the black
holes first decreases during this period and then reaches a plateau, dropping
by only a factor of $\sim 3$ despite its rapid inspiral. An estimated
bolometric light curve follows the same profile. The minidisks through which
the accretion reaches the black holes are very non-standard. Reynolds, not
Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two distinct structural
states. In one part of the cycle, ``sloshing"" streams transfer mass from one
minidisk to the other through the L1 point at a rate $\sim 0.1\times$ the
accretion rate, carrying kinetic energy at a rate that can be as large as the
peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that the minidisks have
time-varying tilts with respect to the orbital plane similar in magnitude to
the circumbinary disk's aspect ratio. The unsigned poloidal flux on the black
hole event horizon is roughly constant at a dimensionless level $\phi\sim 2-3$,
but doubles just before merger; if the black holes had significant spin, this
flux could support jets whose power could approach the radiated luminosity.

radiation. For this purpose, we utilize the doubly holographic theories and
study the entanglement entropy of the radiation to find the Page curve

two types of boundaries in the AdS bulk, namely the usual AdS boundary and the
Planck brane. In such a setup, we calculate the entanglement entropy by
examining two extremal surfaces: the Hartman-Maldacena (HM) surface and the
island surface. The latter surface emerges when the island appears on the
Planck brane. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of dyonic black
holes with regard to the Page curve in the context of the doubly holographic

included in the Planck brane to describe the systems at finite density and
magnetic field. Furthermore, we also develop a general numerical method to
compute the time-dependent HM surface and achieve excellent agreement between
the numerical results and analytical expressions. Utilizing numerical
methodology, we find that the entanglement entropy of dyonic black holes
exhibits unitary evolution over time, wherein it grows in early time and
reaches saturation after the Page time. The initial growth can be explained by
the HM surface, while the saturation is attributed to the island surface. In

proof can be extended to more general cases. In this paper, we prove that under
some reasonable conditions, the Tolman law always holds for a perfect fluid in

number density $n$ can not be determined by the energy density $\rho$ and
pressure $p$ via the equations of state. This is true for many known fluids

  formula",,[{'name': 'Fani Dosopoulou'}],,2023-05-26T22:00:42Z,"We consider the intermediate mass-ratio inspiral of a stellar-mass compact
object with an intermediate-mass black hole that is surrounded by a dark matter
density spike. The interaction of the inspiraling black hole with the dark
matter particles in the spike leads to dynamical friction. This can alter the
dynamics of the black hole binary, leaving an imprint on the gravitational wave
signal. Previous calculations did not include in the evaluation of the
dynamical friction coefficient the contribution from particles that move faster
than the black hole. This term is neglected in the standard Chandrasekhar's
treatment where only slower moving particles contribute to the decelerating
drag. Here, we demonstrate that dynamical friction produced by the fast moving
particles has a significant effect on the evolution of a massive binary within
a dark matter spike. For a density profile $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma\lesssim 1$, the dephasing of the gravitational waveform can be several
orders of magnitude larger than estimated using the standard treatment. As
$\gamma$ approaches $0.5$ the error becomes arbitrarily large. Finally, we show
that dynamical friction tends to make the orbit more eccentric for any $\gamma
< 1.8$. However, energy loss by gravitational wave radiation is expected to
dominate the inspiral, leading to orbital circularization in most cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17281v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

posterior data products. In the case of spin-weight 2 fields, Almanac infers
$E$- and $B$-mode power spectra and parity-violating $EB$ power, and, by
sampling the full posteriors rather than point estimates, it avoids the problem
of $EB$-leakage. For theories with no $B$-mode signal, inferred non-zero
$B$-mode power may be a useful diagnostic of systematic errors or an indication
of new physics. Almanac's aim is to characterise the statistical properties of

the impact of extreme miniaturization of the QDs, achieved through a reduction

contains gravitational (Chern-Simons (CS) type) anomalies and torsion, arising
from the fundamental degrees of freedom of the massless gravitational multiplet
of an underlying microscopic string theory. The model leads to RVM type
inflation without external inflatons, arising from the quartic powers of the
Hubble parameter that characterise the vacuum energy density due to
primordial-gravitational-wave-induced anomaly CS condensates, and dominate the
inflationary era. In modern eras, of relevance to this work, the gravitational
anomalies are cancelled by chiral matter, generated at the end of the RVM
inflationary era, but cosmic radiation and other matter fields are still
responsible for a RVM energy density with terms exhibiting a
quadratic-power-of-Hubble-parameter dependence, but also products of the latter
with logarithmic $H$-dependencies, arising from potential quantum-gravity and
quantum-matter loop effects. In this work, such terms are examined
phenomenologically from the point of view of the potential alleviation of the

deformation in medical data. Recent Deep Learning methods have shown promising
accuracy and speedup for registering a pair of medical images. However, in 4D
(3D + time) medical data, organ motion, such as respiratory motion and heart
beating, can not be effectively modeled by pair-wise methods as they were
optimized for image pairs but did not consider the organ motion patterns
necessary when considering 4D data. This paper presents ORRN, an Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODE)-based recursive image registration network. Our
network learns to estimate time-varying voxel velocities for an ODE that models
deformation in 4D image data. It adopts a recursive registration strategy to
progressively estimate a deformation field through ODE integration of voxel
velocities. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available lung 4DCT
datasets, DIRLab and CREATIS, for two tasks: 1) registering all images to the
extreme inhale image for 3D+t deformation tracking and 2) registering extreme
exhale to inhale phase images. Our method outperforms other learning-based
methods in both tasks, producing the smallest Target Registration Error of
1.24mm and 1.26mm, respectively. Additionally, it produces less than 0.001\%
unrealistic image folding, and the computation speed is less than 1 second for
each CT volume. ORRN demonstrates promising registration accuracy, deformation
plausibility, and computation efficiency on group-wise and pair-wise

parameter region $0<w\leq 1/3$ since the larger value of the spin is expected
for the softer equation of state than that of the radiation fluid ($w=1/3$).
The angular momentum inside the collapsing region is estimated based on the
linear perturbation equation at the turn-around time which we define as the
time when the linear velocity perturbation in the conformal Newtonian gauge
takes the minimum value. The probability distribution is derived based on the
peak theory with the Gaussian curvature perturbation. We find that the root
mean square of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $\sqrt{\langle

typical value of the spin parameter decreases with the value of $w$. We also
evaluate the mass and spin distribution $P(a_{*}, M)$, taking account of the
critical phenomena. We find that, while the spin is mostly distributed in the

Spin-2 dark matter from inflation,,[{'name': 'Mohammad Ali Gorji'}],,2023-05-22T18:00:17Z,"The seed of dark matter can be generated from light spectator fields during
inflation through a similar mechanism that the seed of observed large scale
structures are produced from the inflaton field. The accumulated energy density
of the corresponding excited modes, which is subdominant during inflation,
dominates energy density of the universe later around the time of matter and
radiation equality and plays the role of dark matter. For spin-2 spectator
fields, Higuchi bound may seem to prevent excitation of such light modes since
deviation of the inflationary background from the exact de Sitter spacetime is
very small. However, sizable interactions with the inflaton field breaks (part

$\mathrm{^3P_1} \rightarrow \mathrm{^3P_0}$ fine structure line at projected
distances of up to 78"" from the star. The line profiles are characterized by
both direct fitting of Gaussian components, and by modeling the observed line
of the [CI] triplet. We also report the detection of the $\mathrm{^2P_{3/2}}

[CI] emission from IRC +10216 agrees with more limited previous studies. The
satisfying agreement between the observed and modeled line profiles, with
emission at the systemic velocity appearing beyond one beam from the star,
rules out that the C0 is located in a thin shell. Given that the bond energy of
CO falls only 0.1 eV below the ionization threshold of C0, the absence of
observable [CII] emission from sightlines beyond a projected distance of $\sim
10^{17}$ cm from the star (adopting a distance of 130 pc) does not contradict a
scenario where the bulk of C0 is located between that of CO and C+, as expected
for an external FUV radiation field. This conjecture is also corroborated by a
model in which the C0 shell is located farther outside, failing to reproduce
the [CI] line profiles at intermediate sky-plane distances from the star.
Comparing a photo-chemical model adopted from literature with the simplifying

position of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), where $m$ and $e$ are

ISCO radius can be very close to the gravitational radius. We demonstrate that
the properties of such orbits can be effectively and easily found by using a
properly constructed ``near-horizon approximation''. In particular, we show
that the effective potential (which determines the position of the orbit) can
be written in a form which is invariant under rescaling of the magnetic field,
and as a result is universal in this sense. We also demonstrate that in the
near-horizon approximation, the particle orbits are stationary worldlines in
Minkowski spacetime. We use this property to solve the equation describing slow
changes in the distance of the particle orbit from the horizon, which arise as

untenable. Concentrating the dust in a disk or torus can in principle hide a

$E=mc^2$ by considering electromagnetic processes taking place in vacuo.
Poincar\'e's treatment is based on a generalization of the law of conservation
of momentum to include radiation. Einstein's analysis relies solely on energy
conservation and the relativity principle together with certain assumptions,
which have served as the source of criticism of the paper beginning with Max
Planck in 1907. We show that these objections raised by Planck and others can
be traced back to Einstein's failure to make use of momentum considerations.
Relevance of our findings to a proper understanding of Ives' criticism of

physical entropy which increases throughout this process in a way consistent
with unitarity. We have suggested that (instead of coarse-grained entropy)
physical entropy is matter-gravity entanglement entropy and that this may offer
an explanation of entropy increase both for the black hole collapse and
evaporation system and also for other closed unitarily evolving systems. For
this to work, the matter-gravity entanglement entropy of the late-time state of
black hole evaporation would have to be larger than the entropy of the freshly

space of the SUSY-based WIMP model is ruled out. In addition, WIMP as the CDM
particle is also at variance with other astrophysical observables at small
scales. We consider a model that addresses both these issues. In the model, the
WIMP decays into a massive particle and radiation. We study the background
evolution and the first order perturbation theory (coupled Einstein-Boltzmann
equations) for this model and show that the dynamics can be captured by a
single parameter $r=m_L/q$, which is the ratio of the lighter mass and the
comoving momentum of the decay particle. We incorporate the relevant equations

CMB angular power spectra. The decaying WIMP model is akin to a non-thermal
Warm Dark Matter(WDM) model and suppresses matter power at small scales, which
could alleviate several issues that plague the CDM model. We compare the
predictions of the model with CMB, galaxy clustering, and high-z HI data. Both

weighting of the collinear-to-soft radiations in the jet. In this article, we
focus on angularity exponents $a<1$ and provide detailed results for $a=-1,0$,

the soft function remains unmodified for $a<1$. For all values of $a$, we find
that in the medium, the distributions are narrower and have a steeper fall

merging facial scans and CBCT images are due to the different image acquisition
methods and limited area of correspondence between the two facial surfaces. In
addition, it is difficult to use machine learning techniques because they use
face-related 3D medical data with radiation exposure, which are difficult to
obtain for training. The proposed method addresses these problems by reusing an
existing machine-learning-based 2D landmark detection algorithm in an
open-source library and developing a novel mathematical algorithm that
identifies paired 3D landmarks from knowledge of the corresponding 2D
landmarks. A main contribution of this study is that the proposed method does
not require annotated training data of facial landmarks because it uses a
pre-trained facial landmark detection algorithm that is known to be robust and
generalized to various 2D face image models. Note that this reduces a 3D
landmark detection problem to a 2D problem of identifying the corresponding
landmarks on two 2D projection images generated from two different projection
angles. Here, the 3D landmarks for registration were selected from the
sub-surfaces with the least geometric change under the CBCT and face scan

Remarkably, we show that one galaxy can reproduce the variety of a large sample

large parameter space in terms of peak velocities, peak separation and flux
ratio. This diversity originates from radiative transfer effects at ISM and CGM
scales, and depends on galaxy inclination and evolutionary phase. Red-dominated
lines preferentially arise in face-on directions during post-starburst outflows
and are bright. Conversely, accretion phases usually yield symmetric double
peaks in the edge-on direction and are fainter. While resonant scattering
effects at $< 0.2\times R_{\rm vir}$ are responsible for the broadening and

assumes a pivotal role. Our model takes into account the loss of angular
momentum due to radiation and the scale-height derivative in the basic
equations of the GR slim disk. For comparison purposes, we also provide a new
analytical solution for a radiation-pressure-dominant GR slim disk, which
neglects the angular momentum loss due to radiation and the scale-height

scale height derivative into the basic equations. As a result, the surface
density near the disk's inner edge decreases, whereas the disk temperature and
scale height increase, brightening the disk spectrum in the soft X-ray
waveband. Notably, an extremely high mass accretion rate significantly enhances
the effect of the scale-height derivative, affecting the entire disk. In
contrast, the inclusion of the radiation-driven angular momentum loss only
slightly influences the disk surface density and temperature compared with the
case of the scale-height derivative inclusion. The X-ray luminosity increases
significantly due to scale height derivative for $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}

of the small-amplitude excitation spectrum shows that as the number of
particles increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to emit particles

the three simulations return similar predictions for the global 21cm rightness

attributable to differences in the history of reionization, in turn driven by
differences in the build-up of stellar sources of radiation. However, the

unique signatures. First, we find significant small scale ($k \geq 10\, \rm

velocity winds generated by supernova feedback soften density peaks and lead to
lower 21cm power in TNG. Second, we find more 21cm power at intermediate scales

driven by highly effective stellar feedback, leading to lower star formation,
older and redder stellar populations, and thus lower ionizing luminosities.

production of DM $\chi$ from SM bath through the mediation of ALP, via
ALP-portal processes. These interactions involve non-renormalizable operators,
leading to ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in, which depends on the reheating
temperature ($T_{RH}$) of the early universe. In the NS cosmological scenario,
the faster expansion rate suppresses the DM production processes, allowing for
enhanced effective couplings between the visible and dark sectors to satisfy
the observed DM abundance compared to RD scenario. This improved coupling
increases the detection prospects for freeze-in DM via the ALP-portal, which is
otherwise challenging to detect in RD universe due to small couplings involved.
Using an effective field theory set-up, we show that various ALP searches such

processes a chemical potential that controls the particle occupation number.
While the usual parameterization using the free-streaming scale or the particle

Doppler images with B-mode images to increase the segmentation accuracy and
robustness of small blood vessels. It incorporates two encoders to exploit the
maximum potential of the Doppler signal and recurrent neural network modules to
preserve sequential information. Input to the first encoder is a two-channel

the pure Doppler images to provide a region proposal. Secondly, benefiting from
the Doppler signal, this work first introduces an online artery
re-identification module to qualitatively evaluate the real-time segmentation
results and automatically optimize the probe pose for enhanced Doppler images.
This quality-aware module enables the closed-loop control of robotic screening

Furthermore, we generally discuss the properties of the spectra and

its relation to annihilating dark matter (DM). The main aspect is the predicted
effect of asymmetry of the intensity of emission due to inverse Compton
scattering (ICS) of a possible population of relativistic electrons and
positrons ($e^\pm$) in the galactic halo on starlight photons. This asymmetry
is expected to exist around the major galactic axis, and arises due to
anisotropy of the interstellar radiation field and the inclination of M31. ICS
emission and its asymmetry were modeled by GALPROP code for the trial case of
$e^\pm$ generated by annihilating weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
with various properties. The asymmetry was obtained to appear at photon
energies above $\sim$ 0.1 MeV. Morphological and spectral properties of the
asymmetry were studied in detail. Potential observational detection of the
asymmetry may allow to infer the leptonic fraction in the emission generation
mechanism, thus providing valuable inferences for understanding the nature of
M31 gamma-ray halo emission. Specific asymmetry predictions were made for the
recently claimed DM interpretation of the outer halo emission. The paper also
studied the role of secondary -- ICS and bremsstrahlung -- emissions due to DM

to strong DC electric fields (10 kV/m and above). Understanding the resilience
of TESs to DC electric fields is essential when considering their use as
charged particle spectrometers, a field in which TESs could have an enormous
impact. Techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy produce a high
number of low-energy electrons that are not of interest and can be screened
from the detector using electrostatic deflection. The use of strong electric

Integrating electron optics into the TES membrane provides an elegant and

$10^{19}-10^{22} \rm ~W cm^{-2}$ available in laboratory. However,
non-monoenergetic protons with much lower energies than prediction were usually
observed in RPA experiments, because of too small foil thickness which is hard
to bear insufficient laser contrast and foil surface roughness. Besides the
technical problems, we here find that there is an upper-limit thickness
$L_{up}$ derived from the requirement that the laser energy density should
dominate over the ion source, and $L_{up}$ is lower than $ L_{mat}$ with the
intensity below $10^{22} \rm~ W cm^{-2}$, which causes inefficient or unsteady
RPA. As the intensity is enhanced to $\geq 10^{23} \rm ~W cm^{-2}$ provided by
10-100 PW laser facilities, $L_{up}$ can significantly exceed $L_{mat}$ and
therefore RPA becomes efficient. In this regime, $L_{mat}$ acts as a
lower-limit thickness for efficient RPA, so the matching thickness can be
extended to a continuous range from $L_{mat}$ to $L_{up}$; the range can reach
micrometers, within which foil thickness is adjustable. This makes RPA steady
and meanwhile the above technical problems can be overcome. Particle-in-cell
simulation shows that multi-GeV quasi-monoenergetic proton beams can be
steadily generated and the fluctuation of the energy peaks and the energy

tunability. Nanostructured graphene has been proposed for active mid-infrared
devices via excitation of tunable surface plasmons, but typically present low
efficiencies due to weak coupling with free-space radiation and plasmon
damping. We present an alternative approach, in which graphene plasmons couple
with gold localized plasmons, creating hybridized modes and enhancing the
coupling efficiency. We demonstrate a metasurface in which hybrid plasmons are
excited with transmission modulation rates of 17% under moderate doping (0.35
eV). We also evaluate the metasurface as a mid-infrared modulator, measuring
switching speeds of up to 16 kHz. Finally, we propose a scheme in which we can

runaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive
nickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far.
SN2018ibb is a H-poor SLSN at $z=0.166$ that evolves extremely slowly compared
to the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored
its photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the NIR with 2-10m
class telescopes. SN2018ibb radiated $>3\times10^{51} \rm erg$ during its
evolution, and its bolometric light curve reached $>2\times10^{44} \rm
erg\,s^{-1}$ at peak. The long-lasting rise of $>93$ rest-frame days implies a
long diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN
mechanism naturally provides both the energy source ($^{56}$Ni) and the long
diffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions for their
photometric and spectroscopic properties. SN2018ibb complies with most tests on
the light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, potentially all tests with
the interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require
25-44 $M_\odot$ of freshly nucleosynthesised $^{56}$Ni, pointing to the
explosion of a metal-poor star with a He-core mass of 120-130 $M_\odot$ at the
time of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection
of [Co II]$\lambda$1.025$\mu$m, which has never been observed in any other PISN
candidate or SLSN before. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a
black hole, can be excluded with high confidence. This makes SN2018ibb by far

significantly increase the abundance of UV-bright galaxies due to the upscatter

variability, $\sigma_{\rm UV} \approx 0.75$ mag, matches the observational

necessary when moving to higher redshifts, reaching $\sigma_{\rm UV} \approx
2.0\,(2.5)\,{\rm mag}$ at $z\approx 12$ ($16$). This implied variability is
consistent with expectations of physical processes in high-redshift galaxies

greater control of the radiation amplitude. This surface is crucial for
designing compact low-cost wideband wireless systems, wherein ultra-massive

brightens by several magnitudes, produces a low- and high-velocity
mass-outflow, and, in some cases, ejects bipolar jets. In this paper, we
complement the current picture of these outbursts by the transient emergence of
a neutral region in the orbital plane of symbiotic binaries consisting of wind
from the giant. We prove its presence by determining H$^0$ column densities

Rayleigh scattering on atomic hydrogen for all suitable objects, i.e.,
eclipsing symbiotic binaries, for which a well-defined ultraviolet spectrum

observed with the FAST and Arecibo telescopes at $L$ band and the GBT telescope
at $C$ band, we investigate these puzzles through Monte Carlo simulations. The
intrinsic energy function (E-function) is modeled as $dp/dE\propto
E^{-\alpha_{\rm E}}$, and the spectral profile is described as a Gaussian
function. A fringe pattern of its spectral peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm p}$) in
0.5-8 GHz is inferred from the $\nu_{\rm p}$ distribution of the GBT sample. We
estimate the likelihood of $\alpha_{\rm E}$ and the standard deviation of the
spectral profile ($\sigma_{\rm s}$) by utilizing the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K-S)
test probability for the observed and simulated specific E-distributions. Our
simulations yields $\alpha_{\rm E}=1.82^{+0.10}_{-0.30}$ and $\sigma_{\rm

These results suggest that a single power-law function is adequate to model the

both physical and observational reasons, i.e. narrow spectral width for a

relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasma with strong synchrotron
cooling and a small mass fraction of non-radiating ions. Our results
demonstrate that the structure of the current sheet is highly sensitive to the
dynamic efficiency of radiative cooling. Specifically, stronger cooling leads
to more significant compression of the plasma and magnetic field within the
plasmoids. We demonstrate that ions can be efficiently accelerated to energies
exceeding the plasma magnetization parameter, $\gg\sigma$, and form a hard
power-law energy distribution, $f_i\propto \gamma^{-1}$. This conclusion
implies a highly efficient proton acceleration in the magnetospheres of young
pulsars. Conversely, the energies of pairs are limited to either $\sigma$ in
the strong cooling regime or the radiation burnoff limit, $\gamma_{\rm syn}$,
when cooling is weak. We find that the high-energy radiation from pairs above

efficiently produced in the strong cooling regime, $\gamma_{\rm syn} < \sigma$.
In this regime, we find that the spectral cutoff scales as $\varepsilon_{\rm

  matter search",,[{'name': 'Vadim A. Bednyakov'}],,2023-05-03T11:33:12Z,"In the paper expressions are obtained for the event rates expected in
experiments aimed at direct detection of dark matter (DM) particles. These
expressions allow one to estimate the rates taking into account simultaneously
elastic (coherent) and inelastic (incoherent) channels of DM particle
interaction with nuclei. The nonzero nuclear excitation energies are used in
the calculation of the inelastic scattering contributions. A strong correlation
between the excitation energy and the recoil energy of the excited nucleus
limits the possibility of the inelastic channel detection with a number of
nuclei. Together with the standard model of the DM distribution in the Galaxy
some models are considered, which allow higher speeds of the DM particle. As
the nuclear recoil energy, TA, increases, the dominance of the elastic
interaction channel is smoothly replaced by the dominance of the inelastic one.
Therefore, if a detector is set up to detect only elastic scattering events, it
starts to lose capability of seeing anything. The only way to notice the
interaction remains the gamma radiation from the deexcitation of the nucleus.
In the case of spin-independent DM interaction, as TA increases, the inelastic
contribution quickly dominates. If the DM particle interacts only
spin-dependently, the detectors focused on registration of the elastic
spin-dependent DM signal will see nothing, since the signal goes through the
inelastic channel. It looks like the desired DM interaction could have a
noticeable intensity, but the DM detector is unable to detect it. Therefore, a
setup aimed at the direct DM detection should register two signals. The first
is the nuclear recoil energy and the second is the gamma-quanta with a certain
energy from the target nucleus deexitation. The experiment will provide the
complete information about the DM interaction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02050v1,"[{'term': 'hep-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

topic with contradictory research findings. A comprehensive understanding of
the response of urban and rural areas to HWs, considering the underlying cause
of surface energy budget changes, remains elusive. This study attempts to
address this gap by investigating a 2020 HW event in the Greater Sydney Area
using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Findings
indicate that the HW intensifies the nighttime surface UHI by approximately
4{\deg}C. An analysis of surface energy budgets reveals that urban areas store
more heat during the HW due to receiving more solar radiation and less
evapotranspiration compared to rural areas. The maximum heat storage flux in
urban during the HW can be around 200 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. The
stored heat is released at nightime, raising the air temperature in the urban
areas. Forests and savannas have relatively lower storage heat fluxes due to
high transpiration and albedo, and the maximum heat storage flux is only around
50 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. In contrast, a negative synergistic
effect is detected between the 2-m UHI and HW. This may be because other
meteorological conditions including wind have substantial impacts on the air
temperature pattern. The strong hot and dry winds coming from the west and the
proximity of tall buildings to the coast diminish the sea breeze coming from
the east, resulting in a higher air temperature in the western urban district.
Meanwhile, the western forest area also experiences higher temperatures due to
the westward winds. In addition, changes in wind direction alter the
temperature distribution in the northern rural region. Based on the present
study, urban climate simulation data and associated findings can be used to
develop urban heat mitigation strategies for UHI during HW.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01947v1,"[{'term': 'physics.ao-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

probe interstellar and circumstellar magnetic fields, because aspherical grains

Alignment Torque (RAT) mechanism provides a theoretical framework to this
phenomenon, some aspects of this alignment mechanism still need to be
quantitatively tested. One such aspect is the possibility that the reference
alignment direction changes from the magnetic field (""B-RAT"") to the radiation
field k-vector (""k-RAT"") in areas of strong radiation fields. We investigate
this transition toward the Orion Bar PDR, using multi-wavelength SOFIA HAWC+

radiation field direction is on average not the preferred grain alignment axis.
We constrain the grain sizes for which the transition from B-RAT to k-RAT occur
in the Orion Bar (grains > 0.1 {\mu}m toward the most irradiated locations),
and explore the radiatively driven rotational disruption that may take place in
the high-radiation environment of the Bar for large grains. While the grains
susceptible to rotational disruption should be in supra-thermal rotation and
aligned with the magnetic field, k-RAT aligned grains would rotate at thermal
velocities. We find that the grain size at which the alignment shifts from
B-RAT to k-RAT corresponds to grains too large to survive the rotational
disruption. Therefore, we expect a large fraction of grains to be aligned at
supra-thermal rotation with the magnetic field, and potentially be subject to
rotational disruption depending on their tensile strength.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01908v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

detected EPR (cross-polar) signal is polarized orthogonal to the incident

wave, pulsed, and rapid-scan. An adjustable sample positioner allows for
optimizing sample position to maximize the 240 GHz magnetic field B1, and a

the signal and minimize the co-polar background. When optimized, the co-polar
isolation (the ratio of incident to detected co-polar signal) was around 50 dB,
an improvement of over 20 dB. This large isolation is especially beneficial for
maximizing the SNR of rapidscan EPR, but also improves the SNR in pulsed and

hydrodynamical simulations suggest that this is far from reality. We calculate
the H alpha emission from multidimensional accretion onto a gas giant,
following the gas flow from Hill-sphere scales down to the circumplanetary disc

we do not smooth the gravitational potential and do follow the flow down to the
planetary surface, where grid cells are 0.01 Jupiter radii small radially. We
find that only roughly one percent of the net gas inflow into the Hill sphere
reaches directly the planet. As expected for ballistic infall trajectories,
most of the gas falls at too large a distance on the CPD to generate H alpha.
Including radiation transport removes the high-velocity sub-surface flow
previously seen in hydrodynamics-only simulations, so that only the free planet
surface and the inner regions of the CPD emit substantially H alpha. Unless
magnetospheric accretion, which we neglect here, additionally produces H alpha,

considered in two separate theoretical models. Solutions to the linearized
quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equations are first used to show that the
vertical length scale of a tropopause geopotential anomaly is initially
shallow, but significantly increased by diabatic heating from radiative
relaxation. This process is deemed as geostrophic adjustment of the
stratosphere to tropospheric forcing. Idealized, time-dependent calculations
show that tropopause geopotential anomalies can appreciably rise in the
stratosphere on time scales of a couple months. A previously developed, coupled
troposphere-stratosphere model is introduced and modified to further understand
how tropospheric geopotential forcing can induce upwelling in the stratosphere.
Solutions to steady, zonally-symmetric sea-surface-temperature forcings in the
linear $\beta$-plane model show that the upwards stratospheric penetration of
the thermally induced tropopause geopotential anomaly is controlled by a
non-dimensional parameter that depends on the ratio between the time scale of
wave-drag to that of radiation. It is also shown that the horizontal scale of
the tropopause geopotential anomaly modulates the vertical scale of the
anomaly. When Earth-like non-dimensional parameters are used, the theoretical
model predicts stratospheric temperature anomalies around two times larger in
magnitude than those in the boundary layer, approximately in line with
observational data. The results are argued to show that wave-drag alone may not
suffice to explain certain observed features of the lower stratosphere,

that vacuum resonances can significantly alter the emission from the poles of

atmospheres of isolated neutron stars and can result in suppression of the
continuum and the cyclotron lines. It is enhanced by magnetic Comptonization in
the hot plasma and proximity to the electron cyclotron resonance. We present
several models to illustrate the vacuum polarization effect for various

r-production by NSMs. However, the most direct evidence for such SNe, unusual
reddening of the emission caused by the high opacities of r-process elements,

material within the SN ejecta as a key predictor of the ease with which signals

distribution results from hydrodynamic processes at play during the SN
explosion, thus far it has been treated only in a parameterized way. We use
hydrodynamic simulations to model how disk winds, the alleged locus of
r-production in rare SNe, mix with initially r-process-free ejecta. We study
mixing as a function of the wind mass and duration and of the initial SN
explosion energy, and find that it increases with the first two of these and
decreases with the third. This suggests that SNe accompanying the longest

been recently indicated in the millisecond pulsar J0030+0451. Under these
conditions, the electromagnetic rocket effect may be activated, where the
magnetic field exerts a net force, accelerating the star. This post-natal kick
mechanism relies on asymmetric electromagnetic radiation from an off-centre
dipole may be relevant to the high spatial velocities of pulsars $\sim 10^{3}$
$\rm{km/s}$. Here, we explore its impact in young pulsars associated with
supernova remnants and we compare the observational data on characteristic
quantities, such as the braking index and proper motion, with results obtained
from the rocket effect. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we explore
the required conditions, for the initial spin periods and the distance between
the magnetic axis and the star's center, so that the velocity kick due to the
rocket effect approaches the present velocity. We find that the electromagnetic
rocket effect can account for typical pulsar transverse velocities assuming an
initial spin period of 3.8 $\rm{ms}$ and a dipole field whose distance from the
centre of the star is approximately 7 $\rm{km}$. We also explore the influence
of the rocket effect on the braking index of a neutron star, and we find that
for the sample studied this impact is minimal. Finally, we apply the rocket
effect model on the pulsars J0030+0451 and J0538+2817, which are likely
candidates for this mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00025v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

fluorescence dynamics of dilute atomic ensemble driven by resonant pulse
radiation. We show that even for sub-Doppler temperatures, the motion of atoms
can significantly affect the nature of both superradiation and subradiation. We
also demonstrate that, in the case of an ensemble of moving scatterers, it is
possible to observe the nonmonotonic time dependence of the fluorescence rate.
This leads to the fact that, in certain time intervals, increasing in
temperature causes not an decrease but increase of the fluorescence intensity
in the cone of coherent scattering. We have analyzed the role of the frequency
diffusion of secondary radiation as a result of multiple light scattering in an
optically dense medium. It is shown that spectrum broadening is the main factor
which determines radiation trapping upon resonant excitation. At later time,
after the trapping stage, the dynamics is dominated by close pairs of atoms
(dimers). The dynamics of the excited states of these dimers has been studied
in detail. It is shown that the change in the lifetime of the given adiabatic
term of the diatomic quasi-molecule induced by the change in the interatomic
distance as well as possible non-adiabatic transitions between sub- and
superradiant states caused by atomic motion can lead not to the anticipated
weakening of subradiation effect but to its enhancement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14968v1,"[{'term': 'quant-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.atom-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

decrease the efficiency of TR cells. However, careful treatment of the

low-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively
impact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep

be easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude

multiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may

sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners possibly allows
to overcome the small branching ratio for positron production from 90Y decays
and to improve for the post-treatment dosimetry of 90Y of selective internal
radiation therapy.
  Methods: For the challenging case of an image quality body phantom, we
compare a full Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation with the results from the two
commercial software packages Simplicit90Y and Hermes. The voxel dosimetry
module of Hermes relies on the 90Y images taken with a LAFOV PET/CT, while the
MC and Simplicit90Y dose calculations are image independent.
  Results: The resulting doses from the MC calculation and Simplicit90Y agree
well within the error margins. The image-based dose calculation with Hermes,
however, consistently underestimates the dose. This is due to the mismatch of
the activity distribution in the PET images and the size of the volume of
interest. Furthermore, there are likely limitations of Hermes' dose calculation
algorithm for 90Y. We found that only for the smallest phantom sphere there is
a statistically significant dependence of the Hermes dose on the image
reconstruction parameters and scan time.
  Conclusion: Our study shows that Simplicit90Y's local deposition model can
provide a reliable dose estimate. On the other hand, the image based dose
calculation requires further benchmarks and verification in order to take full
advantage of LAFOV PET/CT systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14797v1,"[{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

that pulsars with low $L$ value emit gravitational radiation and fall within
the r-mode instability region if the primary dissipative mechanism is shear
viscosity along the crust-core interface boundary layer. The r-mode
perturbation amplitude increases because of GW emissions, in contrast to other
non-radial perturbations which transport to infinity the star's angular
momentum. Thus the presence of these stellar perturbations implies a
non-negative rate of change in transfer of rotational angular momentum. This

hypotheses. Herein, we investigate the more basic hypothesis that quantum
vacuum fluctuations power a quantum engine that converts entanglement energy
into useful electrical work. The system under review is composed of two
atom-level quantum dots that are tunnel-coupled and exhibit a magnetic exchange
interaction. This working substance is connected in series with two
ferromagnetic electrodes. The engine cycle comprises two strokes. The
thermalizing stroke puts the system into equilibrium with the electrode baths,
leading to a release of electrical energy into the leads and to an increase in
the system entropy due to entanglement. Then the measurement stroke breaks the
entanglement between the two quantum dots, thereby reducing its entropy while
energizing it on average. Using a perturbative master equation approach, we
analytically demonstrate the efficiency of the engine, and we study the cycle
numerically to gain insight into the relevant parameters to maximize power.
Although the possibility of harvesting energy from the quantum vacuum
fluctuations and the interactions with the baths is proven on paper and

exhibits an asymmetric brightness of its jet lobes at optical and NIR
wavelengths. There may be asymmetry in the jet plasma parameters in opposite
jet lobes (e.g. electron density, temperature, and outflow velocity). $Aims.$
We examined the Th 28 jet in a 3""x3"" where the jet material is collimated and
accelerated. Our goal is to map the morphology and determine its physical
parameters to determine the physical origin of such asymmetries. $Methods.$ We
present $JHK$-spectra of Th 28 obtained with the SINFONI on the (VLT, ESO) in
June-July 2015. $Results.$ The [Fe II] emission originates in collimated jet
lobes. Two new axial knots are detected at 1"" in the blue lobe and 1"".2 in the
red lobe. The H$_2$ radiation is emitted from an extended region with a radius
of $\gtrsim270$ au, which is perpendicular to the jet. The PV diagrams of the
bright H$_2$ lines reveal faint H$_2$ emission along both jet lobes as well.
The compact and faint H I emission (Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$) comes from two
regions, namely from a spherical region around the star and from the jet lobes.
The size of the jet launching region is derived as 0"".015 ($\sim$3 au at 185
pc), and the initial opening angle of the Th 28 jet is $\sim28^0$, which makes
this jet substantially less collimated than most jets from other CTTs.
$Conclusions.$ The emission in [Fe II], H$_2$, and H I lines suggests a
morphology in which the ionised gas in the disc appears to be disrupted by the
jet. The resolved disc-like H$_2$ emission most likely arises in the disc
atmosphere from shocks caused by a radial uncollimated wind. The asymmetry of
the [Fe II] photocentre shifts with respect to the jet source arises in the
immediate vicinity of the driving source of Th28 and suggests that the observed
brightness asymmetry is intrinsic as well.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12974v2,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

many features at a fraction of computational cost. Yet, climate simulations
with embedded neural network parameterizations are still challenging and highly
depend on the deep learning solution. This is likely associated with spurious
non-physical correlations learned by the neural networks due to the complexity

of atmospheric subgrid-scale processes of a superparameterized climate model in
which deep convection is explicitly resolved. The resulting causally-informed
neural networks are coupled to the climate model, hence, replacing the
superparameterization and radiation scheme. We show that the climate
simulations with causally-informed neural network parameterizations retain many
convection-related properties of the original high-resolution climate model and
clearly outperform the non-causal approach, while retaining similar
generalization capabilities to unseen climates. The combination of causal

investigate the evolution of large protoplanetary disc populations under the
influence of magnetically driven disc winds as well as internal and external

comparisons with observations. Methods. We ran 1D vertically integrated
evolutionary simulations for low-viscosity discs, including magnetic braking
and various outflows. The initial conditions were varied and chosen to produce
populations that are representative of actual disc populations inferred from
observations. We then compared the observables from the simulations (e.g.
stellar accretion rate, disc mass evolution, disc lifetime, etc.) with
observational data. Results. Our simulations show that to reach stellar
accretion rates comparable to those found by observations $\sim
10^{-8}\mathrm{M}_\odot / \mathrm{yr}$, it is necessary to have access not only
to strong magnetic torques, but weak magnetic winds as well. The presence of a
strong magnetic disc wind, in combination with internal photoevaporation, leads
to the rapid opening of an inner cavity early on, allowing the stellar
accretion rate to drop while the disc is still massive. Furthermore, our model
supports the notion that external photoevaporation via the ambient
far-ultraviolet radiation of surrounding stars is a driving force in disc
evolution and could potentially exert a strong influence on planetary
formation. Conclusions. Our disc population syntheses show that for a subset of

Therefore, observational limits on the dark matter annihilation rate imply a

outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with

branch (AGB) phase, during which they develop strong stellar winds. Recent
observations have revealed significant morphological complexities in their
outflows, most likely caused by a companion. We study the impact of the
radiation force on such companion-perturbed AGB outflows. We present the
implementation of a ray tracer for radiative transfer in smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) and compared four different descriptions of radiative
transfer: the free-wind, the geometrical, the Lucy, and the attenuation
approximation. For both low and high mass-loss rates, the velocity profile of
the outflow is modified when going from the free-wind to the geometrical
approximation, also resulting in a different morphology. In the case of a low
mass-loss rate, the effect of the Lucy and attenuation approximation is
negligible due to the low densities but morphological differences appear in the
high mass-loss rate regime. By comparing the radiative equilibrium temperature
and radiation force to full 3D radiative transfer, we show that the Lucy
approximation works best. Although, close to the companion, artificial heating
occurs and it fails to simulate the shadow cast by the companion. The
attenuation approximation produces a lower equilibrium temperature and weaker
radiation force, but it produces the shadow cast by the companion. From the
predictions of the 3D radiative transfer, we also conclude that a radially
directed radiation force is a reasonable assumption. The radiation force thus
plays a critical role in dust-driven AGB winds, impacting the velocity profile
and morphological structures. For low mass-loss rates, the geometrical
approximation suffices, while high mass-loss rates require a more rigorous
method, where the Lucy approximation provides the most accurate results

to assess electrically small structures and those surpassing it are called
superdirective. Supergain is obtained in a case when internal losses are
mitigated, and an antenna is matched to radiation, though typically in a very

grain emission always seems to be negligible at long wavelengths in our Galaxy,
the contribution of this small dust component could be more important than
expected, in the submm-mm range, in the LMC averaged SED. Properties of the
small dust component of the LMC are clearly different from those of our Galaxy.
Its abundance, significantly enhanced, could be the result of large grains
shattering due to strong shocks or turbulence. In addition, this grain
component in the LMC systematically shows smaller grain size in the ionized

significantly distinct behaviors depending on the dust models but also from one

leading to a reduction of ion target flux. This starts to occur as the
ionisation source detaches from the target, leading to a build-up of molecules
below the ionisation source who get excited, resulting in Molecular Activated
Recombination (MAR) and Dissociation (MAD). The particle sinks in the divertor
chamber exceed the ion sources in the middle of the detached operational regime
before electron-ion recombination (EIR) starts to occur, demonstrating the
strong capabilities for particle exhaust in the Super-X Configuration. MAD is
the dominant volumetric neutral atom creation mechanism and results in
significant power losses. This, combined with electron-impact excitation
preceding ionisation, are the dominant power loss mechanisms in the divertor
chamber. As the plasma becomes more deeply detached, EIR starts to occur and
electron temperatures below 0.2 eV are achieved. Even at such low electron
temperature conditions, MAR is observed to be an important ion sink mechanism,
which suggests the presence of highly vibrationally excited molecules in the
cold detached regime. The total radiative power loss is consistent with
extrapolations of spectroscopic inferences to hydrogenic radiative power
losses, which suggests that intrinsic impurity radiation, despite the carbon
walls, is minor. These observations are observed in Ohmic L-mode, ELM-free
H-mode and type I ELMy H-mode discharges.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09109v1,"[{'term': 'physics.plasm-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"
On the global temperature of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime,,[{'name': 'G. E. Volovik'}],,2023-04-18T13:20:02Z,"It is shown that the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime has the
fundamental temperature. This temperature describes the thermal processes of
decay of the composite particles and the other processes, which are
energetically forbidden in the Minkowski spacetime, but are allowed in the de
Sitter and in SdS backgrounds. In particular, this temperature describes the
probability of ionization of the atom in the SdS, which is observed by the
stationary observer at the point where the shift function (velocity) in the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This activation temperature does
not depend on the black hole mass and is fully determined by the Hubble
parameter, $T_{\rm SdS}=\sqrt{3}H/\pi$. This temperature is twice the
Bousso-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm BH}$, which characterizes the limit of
degenerate Lorentzian Schwarzschild-de Sitter universe, when the cosmological
and black hole horizons are close to each other, $T_{\rm SdS}=2T_{\rm BH}$.
  The similar doubling of the temperature of Hawking radiation is known in the
pure de Sitter spacetime, where the corresponding local temperature describing
the ionization of atoms is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature, $T_{\rm
dS}=2T_{\rm GH}=H/\pi$. We suggest that the activation temperature $T_{\rm dS}$
can be considered as the thermodynamic temperature of the de Sitter state,

Unfortunately, despite the wide use of thermal sensors, the temperature

conditions. Previous work has studied the effect of wind and other environment
factors on skin temperature, but has not considered the heating effect from
sunlight, which is termed solar loading. Existing device manufacturers
recommend that a subject who has been outdoors in sun re-acclimate to an indoor
environment after a waiting period. The waiting period, up to 30 minutes, is
insufficient for a rapid screening tool. Moreover, the error bias from solar
loading is greater for darker skin tones since melanin absorbs solar radiation.
This paper explores two approaches to address this problem. The first approach
uses transient behavior of cooling to more quickly extrapolate the steady state
temperature. A second approach explores the spatial modulation of solar
loading, to propose single-shot correction with a wide-field thermal camera. A
real world dataset comprising of thermal point, thermal image, subjective, and

X-ray excess in Mrk 421 during the period of extremely low X-ray and very high
energy (VHE) flux in 2013 January. In the model, two populations of
mono-energetic ultrarelativistic electrons are injected into the emission
region that is a magnetized plasmoid propagating along the blazar jet. We
numerically calculate the emitting electron energy distribution by solving a
kinetic equation that incorporates both shock acceleration and stochastic
acceleration processes. Moreover, we infer analytic expressions relating
electrons acceleration, cooling, escape and injection to the observed spectra
and variability. For the injection luminosity in particular, we derive a new
approximate analytical expression for the case of continual injection with a
mono-energetic distribution. Based on a comparison between the theoretical
predictions and the observed SED, we conclude that the hard X-ray excess
observed in Mrk 421 may be due to the synchrotron radiation emitted by an
additional electrons population, which is co-spatial with an electron
population producing simultaneous Optical/UV, soft X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray

heavier Higgsinos decay instantly into the lightest one, with very little
activities. Hence, all pair-produced Higgsinos end up as a pair of the lightest

almost insensitive to the lightest Higgsino lifetime, thereby providing a good
variable to measure its mass. The ratio $\sigma_1/\sigma_2$, instead, mildly
dependent on its mass, can give good information on its lifetime. It is argued
that the lightest Higgsinos in the events are rather slow, as the very

spiral fitting procedure used in the literature to predict the binary's orbital

are diluted by their own thermal expansion down to the average AGB density
profile within a few hundred years and are further disrupted by the action of

consistently with the general principle of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry,
which makes it possible to confront eJBD-based cosmology with observational and
laboratory bounds on time variation of parameters, masses, and coupling
constants, caused by time evolution of eJBD fields. Decomposition of standard
particle physics lagrangian into independent gauge invariant pieces is proposed
to avoid serious conflict that may arise from standard lagrangian transformed
from the Jordan frame. Independent conformal factors are assigned to each of
five gauge invariant pieces. The formulation is most unambiguously made
possible by defining fields having canonical kinetic terms that allow us to use
the canonical quantization rule of field theory. This construction gives as one
of its consequences the canonical eJBD field $\chi$ that couples to the
universal fermion current, a linear combination of baryon and lepton number
currents, $\partial_{\mu} \chi (\frac{1}{3} j_B^{\mu} + j_L^{\mu})$, in
addition to the conventional trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Field
equation of eJBD field along with gravitational equation is analyzed by using a

While the basic OH response to the different dynamical influences has been

ionisation and radiative transfer, are also expected to play a role. A set of
models which include the three relevant atomic processes listed above in
ionisation equilibrium has recently been built. These new results cover the
main elements observed in the transition region. To assess the effectiveness of
the results, the present work predicts spectral line intensities using
differential emission measure modelling. Although limited in some respects,
this differential emission measure modelling does give a good indication of the
impact of the new atomic calculations. The results are compared to predictions
of the coronal approximation and to observations of the average, quiet Sun from
published literature. Significant improvements are seen for the line emission
from Li- and Na-like ions, inter-combination lines and many other lines. From
this study, an assessment is made of how far down into the solar atmosphere the
coronal approximation can be applied, and the range over which the new atomic

"Revisiting the trajectory of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua:
  preference for a radially directed non-gravitational acceleration?",,[{'name': 'Federico Spada'}],,2023-04-14T07:12:36Z,"I present a re-analysis of the available observational constraints on the
trajectory of 'Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object discovered in
the solar system. 'Oumuamua passed through the inner solar system on a
hyperbolic (i.e., unbound) trajectory. Its discovery occurred after perihelion
passage, and near the time of its closest approach to Earth. After being
observable for approximately four months, the object became too faint and was
lost at a heliocentric distance of around 3 au. Intriguingly, analysis of the
trajectory of 'Oumuamua revealed that a dynamical model including only
gravitational accelerations does not provide a satisfactory fit of the data,
and a non-gravitational term must be included. The detected non-gravitational
acceleration is compatible with either solar radiation pressure or recoil due
to outgassing. It has, however, proved challenging to reconcile either
interpretation with the existing quantitative models of such effects without
postulating unusual physical properties for 'Oumuamua (such as extremely low
density and/or unusual geometry, non-standard chemistry). My analysis
independently confirms the detection of the non-gravitational acceleration.
After comparing several possible parametrizations for this effects, I find a
strong preference for a radially directed non-gravitational acceleration,
pointing away from the Sun, and a moderate preference for a power-law scaling
with the heliocentric distance, with an exponent between 1 and 2. These results
provide valuable constraints on the physical mechanism behind the effect; a
conclusive identification, however, is probably not possible on the basis of
dynamical arguments alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06964v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.EP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

introducing dark sector particles. In this work, we perform a Bayesian global
analysis that includes the latest cosmic shear measurement from the DES
three-year survey and the Planck CMB and BAO data. In the early Universe, the
mirror baryon and mirror radiation behave as dark matter and dark radiation,
and their presence modifies the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, the
scattering between mirror baryon and photon generates the dark acoustic
oscillation process, suppressing the matter power spectrum from the cosmic
shear measurement. We demonstrate how current data constrain these corrections
to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find that for a viable solution to the little
hierarchy problem, the proportion of MTH dark matter cannot exceed about $30\%$

potential to alleviate both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, especially if the

the Sn atom can reduce electron density around neighbouring Nb atoms in the

thickness, composition, and thermal stability of the oxide layer formed on

their evolution and ability to form planets. However, nearby (<300 pc)
star-forming regions lack sufficiently massive young stars, while the Trapezium
Cluster and NGC 2024 have complicated star-formation histories and their O-type
stars' intense radiation fields ($>10^4\,G_0$) destroy disks too quickly to
study this process in detail. We study disk mass loss driven by intermediate

Optimization of pencil beam scanning pattern for FLASH proton therapy,,"[{'name': 'Sylvain Deffet'}, {'name': 'Edmond Sterpin'}]",,2023-04-12T09:24:30Z,"Purpose: The FLASH effect, which reduces the radiosensitivity of healthy
tissue while maintaining tumor control at high dose rates, has shown potential
for improving radiation therapy. Conformal FLASH proton therapy involves
advanced beam-shaping technologies and specialized nozzle designs to confine
the dose to the target volume. Optimizing the spot delivery pattern and range
modulators can enhance the local dose rate, and genetic algorithms have been
used to optimize scan patterns for stereotactic FLASH proton therapy of
early-stage lung cancer and lung metastases. A fast and effective method based
on graph theory is proposed to optimize the dose rate in specific regions of
interest.
  Methods: We have created a graph-based algorithm to optimize the trajectory
of proton spots to maximize the 100th percentile dose rate. Since this problem
is NP-hard, we have employed an approximation algorithm that can solve this
kind of Traveling Salesman Problem efficiently.
  Results: When compared to a conventional serpentine pattern, the optimized
scanning trajectory led to a doubling of the median dose rate, but only a minor
increase in DR95. Our approach is more efficient and requires fewer evaluations
of the objective function and hyper-parameters compared to existing genetic
algorithms. Conclusions: The optimized scanning trajectory led to a doubling of
the median dose rate, but only a minor increase in DR95. The extent to which
the dose rate can be increased depends on the size and shape of the region of
interest. Future research could explore integrating FLASH objectives into
treatment planning and incorporating the proposed method into plan

Specifically, we find that the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale is

three orders of magnitude as our sightline progressively samples the wind at

atoms in the disk or its atmosphere; (2) thermal driving, where Compton heating
of the outer accretion disk causes gas thermal velocities to exceed the local
escape speed; and (3) magnetohydrodynamic processes, where gas may be ejected

The main challenge in this approach is the treatment of the compactified

Photons and EM radiation carry angular momentum, which is conserved without
interactions. Chiral interactions with matter, medium, curvature, and theories
with parity violation, i.e., axion-QED, transfers spin angular momentum to EM
fields. In nature, such phenomena occur either on EM radiation (chiral memory)

the standard way to do this. We report on the first application of the
\texttt{SKIRT} radiative transfer code to simulations of a star-forming cloud.
The synthetic observations are then analyzed following traditional
observational workflows. We find that in the early stages of the simulation,
stellar radiation is inefficient in heating dust to the temperatures observed
in Galactic clouds, thus the addition of an interstellar radiation field is
necessary. The spectral energy distribution of the cloud settles rather quickly
after $\sim3$ Myr of evolution from the onset of star formation, but its
morphology continues to evolve for $\sim8$ Myr due to the expansion of
\textsc{Hii} regions and the respective creation of cavities, filaments, and
ridges. Modeling synthetic \textit{Herschel} fluxes with 1- or 2-component
modified black bodies underestimates total dust masses by a factor of $\sim2$.
Spatially-resolved fitting recovers up to about $70\%$ of the intrinsic value.
This ``missing mass'' is located in a very cold dust component with
temperatures below $10$ K, which does not contribute appreciably to the
far-infrared flux. This effect could bias real observations if such dust exists
in large amounts. Finally, we tested observational calibrations of the SFR

two-stream method for computing reflected light and thermal spectra and was
later implemented in the open-source radiative transfer model PICASO. In Part~I
of this series, we developed an analytical spherical harmonics method for
solving the radiative transfer equation for reflected solar radiation (Rooney

code by offering a higher-order approximation. This work is an extension of
this spherical harmonics derivation to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We
highlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and
benchmark the 4-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream
discrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each
model we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in
accuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of
approximation and to the choice of phase function. We also explore the
trade-off between computational time and model accuracy. We find that our

small bodies, composed of amorphous water ice, dust, and ices of other volatile
species that are commonly observed in comets. The heat sources are solar
radiation and the decay of short-lived radionuclides. The bodies are highly
porous and gases released in the interior flow through the porous medium. The
most volatile ices, CO and CH$_4$ , are found to be depleted down to the center
over a time scale on the order of 100 Myr. Sublimation fronts advance from the
surface inward, and when the temperature in the inner part rises sufficiently,
bulk sublimation throughout the interior reduces gradually the volatile ices
content until they are completely lost. All the other ices survive, which is
compatible with data collected by New Horizons on Arrokoth, showing the
presence of methanol, and possibly, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, NH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_6$, but
no hypervolatiles. The effect of short-lived radionuclides is to increase the
sublimation equilibrium temperatures and reduce volatile depletion times. We
consider the effect of the bulk density, abundance ratios and heliocentric
distance. At 100~au, CO is depleted, but CH$_4$ survives to present time,

into the cloud-forming regions of the troposphere; however, the origin of these

tropospheric banding. These axisymmetric waves are magnetohydrodynamic waves
influenced by the rapid rotation, which have been detected in Earth's core, and
have been recently suggested to exist in Jupiter by the observation of magnetic
secular variations by Juno. Using the magnetic field model JRM33, together with
the density distribution model, we compute the expected speed of these waves.
For the waves excited by variations in the zonal jet flows, their wavelength
can be estimated from the width of the alternating jets, yielding waves with a
half period of 3.2-4.7 years in 14-23$^\circ$N, consistent with the intervals
with the cycles of variability of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt and North

sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness,
net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, sea-surface salinity, as
well as a land-sea mask. We find the CNN is able to make skillful predictions

above scalar sector can sustain a Time Crystal-like minimum energy state, with
non-trivial time dependence. In the present work we treat the Time Crystal-like
state as the background (that replaces the classical Minkowski vacuum) and
study cosmic evolution on this ``dynamic'' ground state. In the first part we
re-derive \cite{Chakraborty:2020ktp}, in a covariant and more systematic way,

generated due to the $R^2$-term ($R$ is the Ricci scalar) in quadratic gravity

Did the Universe Reheat After Recombination?,,"[{'name': 'J. Colin Hill'}, {'name': 'Boris Bolliet'}]",,2023-04-07T17:39:08Z,"A key assumption of the standard cosmological model is that the temperature
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation scales with cosmological
redshift $z$ as $T_{\rm CMB}(z) \propto (1+z)$ at all times after recombination
at $z_\star \simeq 1090$. However, this assumption has only been precisely
tested at $z \lesssim 3$. Here, we consider cosmological models with
post-recombination reheating (PRR), in which the CMB monopole temperature
abruptly increases due to energy injection after last scattering. Such a
scenario can potentially resolve tensions between inferences of the current
cosmic expansion rate (the Hubble constant, $H_0$). We consider an explicit
model in which a metastable sub-component of dark matter (DM) decays to
Standard Model photons, whose spectral energy distribution is assumed to be
close to that of the CMB blackbody. A fit to Planck CMB anisotropy, COBE/FIRAS
CMB monopole, and SH0ES distance-ladder measurements yields $H_0 = 71.2 \pm
1.1$ km/s/Mpc, matter fluctuation amplitude $S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.018$, and CMB
temperature increase $\delta T_{\rm CMB} = 0.109^{+0.033}_{-0.044}$ K, which is
sourced by DM decay at $z \gtrsim 10$. However, matter density constraints from
baryon acoustic oscillation and supernovae data highly constrain this scenario,
with a joint fit to all datasets yielding $H_0 = 68.69 \pm 0.35$ km/s/Mpc, $S_8
= 0.8035 \pm 0.0081$, and $\delta T_{\rm CMB} < 0.0342$ K (95% CL upper limit).
These bounds can be weakened if additional dark relativistic species are
present in the early universe, yielding higher $H_0$. We conclude that current
data disfavor models with significant PRR solely through its impact on
background and linear-theory observables, completely independent of CMB
spectral distortion constraints. However, a small amount of such energy
injection could play a role in restoring cosmological concordance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03750v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'hep-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

the wave periods are assumed to be short enough so that the thermal misbalance

wave dynamics remains thermal conduction. The exact solution of the
evolutionary equation is obtained using the Fourier method. This means that it
is possible to trace the evolution of any harmonic of the initial perturbation,

fraction of energy between entropy and slow mode is defined by the thermal
conduction and coronal loop parameters. It is shown for which parameters of
coronal loops it is reasonable to associate the full solution with a slow wave,

of quasi-linear diffusive models. However, quasi-linear models are inadequate
to quantify Alfv\'enic radial transport occurring on timescales comparable to
the azimuthal drift period of $0.1- 10$ MeV electrons. With recent advances in

drift kinetic description of radial transport for planetary radiation belts. We
characterize linear processes that are too fast to be modelled by quasi-linear

dynamically significant. In the linear regime, wave-particle interactions are
categorized in terms of resonant and non-resonant responses. We demonstrate
that the phenomenon of zebra stripes is non-resonant and can originate from the
injection of particles in the inner radiation belts. We derive a radial
diffusion coefficient for a field model that satisfies Faraday's law and that
contains two terms: one scaling as $L^{10}$ independent of the azimuthal number
$m$, and a second one scaling as $m^2 L^6$. In the nonlinear regime, we show
that azimuthally symmetric waves with properties consistent with in situ

New observations of the close neighbourhood of the star are required to

the proposed approach the quantum treatment of the rotational and vibrational
motion of the molecule can be formulated using arbitrary approximations. The
cavity-induced changes in electronic structure are treated perturbatively,
which allows using the existing polished tools of standard quantum chemistry
for determining electronic molecular properties. As a case study, the
rovibrational polaritons and related thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O in an
IR microcavity are computed for varying cavity parameters and applying various
approximations to describe the molecular degrees of freedom. The self-dipole
interaction is found to be significant for nearly all light-matter coupling
strengths investigated, and the molecular polarizability proved to be important
for the correct qualitative behavior of the energy level shifts induced by the
cavity. On the other hand, the magnitude of polarization remains small,
justifying the perturbative approach for the cavity-induced changes in
electronic structure. Comparing results obtained using a high-accuracy
variational molecular model with those obtained utilizing the rigid rotor and
harmonic oscillator approximations revealed that as long as the rovibrational
model is appropriate for describing the field-free molecule, the computed
rovibropolaritonic properties can be expected to be accurate as well. Strong

entropy for thermal radiation; 2) by assuming that the calculation of the
entropy of an oscillator in thermal equilibrium with radiation is carried out
by discrete units of energy. As a consequence, the energy quantization, linear
in frequency, was thus introduced into physics. However, the energy
quantization of the simple harmonic oscillator was originally postulated by
Planck in an incomplete way, i.e., the ground state energy was not assumed to
be null. Of course, this issue has been solved in different ways over time.

The scheme also captures the observed non-monotonic relationship between cloud

  For illustrative purposes, we conducted comparative analyses of the 2006-2019

hypersurface $C_u$ as $t \to \infty$ of the curvature component $\rho =
\frac{1}{4} R_{3434}$ multiplied with $r^3$ tends to a function $P(u, \theta,
\phi)$ on $\mathbb{R} \times S^2$. When taking the limit $u \to + \infty$
(which corresponds to the limit at spacelike infinity), this function tends to
a function $P^+ (\theta, \phi)$ on $S^2$. We prove that the latter limit does
not have any $l=1$ modes. However, it has all the other modes, $l=0, l \geq 2$.
Important derivatives of crucial curvature components do not decay in $u$,
which is a special feature of these more general spacetimes. We show that
peeling of the Weyl curvature components at future null infinity stops at the
order $r^{-3}$, that is $r^{-4} |u|^{+1}$, for large data, and at order $r^{-
\frac{7}{2}}$ for small data. Despite this fact, we prove that angular momentum
at future null infinity is well defined for these spacetimes, due to the good
behavior of the $l=1$ modes involved.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00611v1,"[{'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '83C05', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse
dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due
to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data
at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring
personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable
multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local

multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still
highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized
federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a
local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs
of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET
denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the
denoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN
remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our
method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging

Chromaticity Effects on the Outcomes of Spheroid-based Scored Events,,"[{'name': 'Lisa McBride'}, {'name': 'Michael Pagano'}]",,2023-03-30T18:04:07Z,"The immense popularity of spheroid-based scored events (colloquially

combinations of specific frequencies of electromagnetic magnetic radiation,

differential illumination of the multiplet components and implement them in a

mechanism in tidal disruption events (TDEs). We perform local three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic simulations in a wedge geometry including the gravity to
study stream self-crossing, with emphasis on resolving the collision and
following the subsequent outflow. We find that the collision can contribute to
pre-peak optical emissions by converting $\gtrsim5\%$ of stream kinetic energy
to radiation, yielding prompt emission of $\sim10^{42-44}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The
radiative efficiency is sensitive to stream mass fallback rates, and strongly
depends on the downstream gas optical depth. Even for a sub-Eddington ($10\%$)
mass fallback rate, the strong radiation pressure produced in the collision can
form a local super-Eddington region near the collision site, where a fast,
aspherical outflow is launched. Higher mass fallback rate usually leads to more
optically-thick outflow and lower net radiative efficiency. For
$\dot{M}\gtrsim0.1\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the estimated photosphere size of the
outflow can expand by one to two orders of magnitudes reaching $\sim10^{14}\rm
cm$. The average gas temperature at this photospheric surface is a few
$\times10^{4}$K, roughly consistent with inferred pre-peak photosphere

A re-investigation of debris disc halos,,"[{'name': 'Philippe Thebault'}, {'name': 'Johan Olofsson'}, {'name': 'Quentin Kral'}]",,2023-03-30T15:00:05Z,"A significant fraction of debris discs consist of a bright ring beyond which
extends a wide halo. Such a halo should be made of small grains produced in the
ring of parent bodies (PB) and pushed on high-e orbits by radiation pressure.
It has been shown that, under several simplifying assumptions, the surface
brightness (SB) of this halo should radially decrease as $r^{-3.5}$ in
scattered light. We aim to revisit the halo phenomenon and focus on two so far
unexplored issues: 1) How the unavoidable presence of small unbound grains,
non-isotropic scattering phase functions (SPF) and finite instrument resolution
affect scattered light SB profiles, and 2) How the halo phenomenon manifests
itself at longer wavelengths. We find that unbound grains account for a
significant fraction of the halo's luminosity in scattered light, and can
significantly flatten the SB radial profile. Realistic size-dependent SPFs also
have an effect, resulting here again in shallower SB profiles. For edge-on
discs, non-resolving the vertical profile can also flatten the projected SB. We
show that roughly half of the observationally-derived halo profiles found in
the literature are compatible with our new results, and that roughly half of
the remaining systems are probably shaped by additional processes. We also
propose that, in future observational studies, the characteristics of PB belt
and halos should be fitted separately. In thermal emission, wide halos should
remain detectable up to the far-IR and, with the exception of the $\sim
8-15\mu$m domain, the halo accounts for more than half of the system's total
flux up to $\lambda\sim80-90\mu$m. The halo's contribution strongly decreases
in the sub-mm to mm but still represents a few percents of the system's
luminosity at $\lambda\sim 1$mm. For unresolved systems, the presence of a halo
can also affect the determination of the disc's radius from its SED.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17434v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.EP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This paper contains self consistent modeling of
both: accretion disk with optically thick corona, where the gas is heated by
magneto-rotational instability dynamo (MRI), and cooled by radiation which
undergoes free-free absorption and Compton scattering. Aims. We determine the
parameters of warm corona in AGN using disk-corona structure model that takes
into account magnetic and radiation pressure. We aim to show the role of
thermal instability (TI) as a constraint for warm, optically thick X-ray corona
in AGN. Methods. With the use of relaxation code, the vertical solution of the
disk driven by MRI together with radiative transfer in hydrostatic and
radiative equilibrium is calculated, which allows us to point out how TI
affects the corona for wide range of global parameters. Results. We show that
magnetic heating is strong enough to heat upper layers of the accretion disk
atmosphere, which form the warm corona covering the disk. Magnetic pressure
does not remove TI caused by radiative processes operating in X-ray emitting
plasma. TI disappears only in case of accretion rates higher than 0.2 of
Eddington, and high magnetic field parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$ > 0.1.
Conclusions. TI plays the major role in the formation of the warm corona above

show that the mass of the molecular gas within a fixed radius (500 pc) from the
AGNs (M_mol ~ 10^7-10^8 M_sun) is correlated with the jet power estimated from
X-ray cavities (P_cav ~ 10^42-10^45 erg s^-1). More specifically, the power is
proportional to the average density of the circumnuclear gas. The mass
accretion rate of the circumnuclear gas \dot{M} also has a correlation with
P_cav. On the other hand, the continuum luminosities at ~ 1.4 GHz and ~ 100-300

circumnuclear gas is sustaining the long-term AGN activities (~ 10^7 yr) rather

Frequency-redshift relation of the Cosmic Microwave Background,,"[{'name': 'Ralf Hofmann'}, {'name': 'Janning Meinert'}]",,2023-03-29T14:51:19Z,"We point out that a modified temperature-redshift relation ($T$-$z$ relation)
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can not be deduced by any
observational method that appeals to an a priori thermalisation to the CMB
temperature $T$ of the excited states in a probe environment of independently
determined redshift $z$. For example, this applies to quasar-light absorption
by a damped Lyman-alpha system due to atomic as well as ionic fine-splitting
transitions or molecular rotational bands. Similarly, the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (thSZ) effect cannot be used to extract the CMB's $T$-$z$
relation. This is because the relative line strengths between ground and
excited states in the former and the CMB spectral distortion in the latter case
both depend, apart from environment specific normalisations, solely on the
dimensionless spectral variable $x=\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}$. Since literature on
extractions of the CMB's $T$-$z$ relation always assumes (i)
$\nu(z)=(1+z)\nu(z=0)$ where $\nu(z=0)$ is the observed frequency in the
heliocentric rest frame, the finding (ii) $T(z)=(1+z)T(z=0)$ just confirms the
expected blackbody nature of the interacting CMB at $z>0$. In contrast to
emission of isolated, directed radiation, whose frequency-redshift relation
($\nu$-$z$ relation) is subject to (i), a non-conventional $\nu$-$z$ relation
$\nu(z)=f(z)\nu(z=0)$ of pure, isotropic blackbody radiation, subject to
adiabatically slow cosmic expansion, necessarily has to follow that of the
$T$-$z$ relation $T(z)=f(z)T(z=0)$ and vice versa. In general, the function
$f(z)$ is determined by energy conservation of the CMB fluid in a
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. If the pure CMB is subject to an
SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge principle, then $f(z)=
\left({1/4}\right)^{1/3}(1+z)$ for $z\gg 1$, and $f(z)$ is nonlinear for $z\sim

explore the effects of synchrotron cooling. Magnetic reconnection causes
compression of the plasma and magnetic field deep inside magnetic islands

explain some astrophysical gamma-ray flare observations. Although radiative

detection and measurement of biochemicals and metabolites. However, MRS has low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when concentrations of metabolites are in the range
of the million molars. Standard approach of using a high number of signal
averaging (NSA) to achieve sufficient NSR comes at the cost of a long
acquisition time. Purpose: We propose to use deep-learning approaches to
denoise MRS data without increasing the NSA. Methods: The study was conducted
using data collected from the brain spectroscopy phantom and human subjects. We
utilized a stack auto-encoder (SAE) network to train deep learning models for
denoising low NSA data (NSA = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) randomly truncated from high
SNR data collected with high NSA (NSA=192) which were also used to obtain the
ground truth. We applied both self-supervised and fully-supervised training
approaches and compared their performance of denoising low NSA data based on
improved SNRs. Results: With the SAE model, the SNR of low NSA data (NSA = 1)
obtained from the phantom increased by 22.8% and the MSE decreased by 47.3%.
For low NSA images of the human parietal and temporal lobes, the SNR increased
by 43.8% and the MSE decreased by 68.8%. In all cases, the chemical shift of
NAA in the denoised spectra closely matched with the high SNR spectra,
suggesting no distortion to the spectra from denoising. Furthermore, the
denoising performance of the SAE model was more effective in denoising spectra
with higher noise levels. Conclusions: The reported SAE denoising method is a
model-free approach to enhance the SNR of low NSA MRS data. With the denoising
capability, it is possible to acquire MRS data with a few NSA, resulting in
shorter scan times while maintaining adequate spectroscopic information for
detecting and quantifying the metabolites of interest.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16503v1,"[{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

black hole, resulting in an elongated stream of gas that partly falls back to
pericenter. Due to apsidal precession, the returning stream may collide with
itself, leading to a self-crossing shock that launches an outflow. If the black
hole spins, this collision may additionally be affected by Lense-Thirring
precession that can cause an offset between the two stream components. We study
the impact of this effect on the outflow properties by carrying out local
simulations of collisions between offset streams. As the offset increases, we
find that the geometry of the outflow becomes less spherical and more
collimated along the directions of the incoming streams, with less gas getting
unbound by the interaction. However, even the most grazing collisions we
consider significantly affect the trajectories of the colliding gas, likely
promoting subsequent strong interactions near the black hole and rapid disc
formation. We analytically compute the dependence of the offset to stream width
ratio, finding that even slowly spinning black holes can cause both strong and
grazing collisions. We propose that the deviation from outflow sphericity may
enhance the self-crossing shock luminosity due to a reduction of adiabatic
losses, and cause significant variations of the efficiency at which X-ray
radiation from the disc is reprocessed to the optical band depending on the

erosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise

($\nu\gtrsim0.03 GM/c$) circumbinary systems decouple late ($a_b\lesssim 15
GM/c^2$) and have qualitatively similar morphologies near merger to
circumbinary systems with constant binary separations. Lower-viscosity
circumbinary disks decouple earlier and exhibit qualitatively different
accretion flows, which lead to precipitously decreasing accretion onto the
binary. If detected, such a decrease may unambiguously identify the host galaxy
of an ongoing event within a LISA error volume. We illustrate how accretion
amplitude and variability evolve as binaries gradually decouple from their
circumbinary disks, and where decoupling occurs over the course of binary
inspirals in the LISA band. We show that, even when dynamically negligible, gas

accretion from a white dwarf in a very eccentric orbit about the central
massive black hole. Evolution under gravitational radiation losses reduces the
separation and eccentricity. I note that below a critical eccentricity $e_{\rm
crit} \simeq 0.97$, the accretion disc's viscous timescale at pericentre
passage is probably longer than the orbital period $P$, and periodic eruptive
behaviour is no longer possible. These QPE descendant systems (QPEDs) are then
likely to produce quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) rather than eruptions,
varying more smoothly over the orbital cycle, with duty cycles $\sim1$. I
identify 2XMM J123103.2+110648 ($P \simeq 3.9$~hr) and (more tentatively) RE
J1034+396 ($P \simeq 1$~hr) as candidate systems of this type, and find
agreement with their deduced eccentricities $e < e_{\rm crit}$. The absence of
eruptions and the lower accretion luminosities resulting from the smaller
gravitational radiation losses may make QPED systems harder to discover.
Ultimately they must evolve to have viscous times much longer than the orbital

variability on ultrafast timescales (i.e. shorter than the light crossing time
of the AGN's supermassive black hole). We propose that ultrafast variability is
a byproduct of the turbulent dissipation of the jet Poynting flux. Due to the
intermittency of the turbulent cascade, the dissipation is concentrated in a
set of reconnecting current sheets. Electrons energised by reconnection have a
strong pitch angle anisotropy, i.e. their velocity is nearly aligned with the
guide magnetic field. Then each current sheet produces a narrow radiation beam,
which dominates the emission from the whole jet when it is directed towards the
observer. The ultrafast variability is set by the light crossing time of a
single current sheet, which is much shorter than the light crossing time of the
whole emission region. The predictions of our model are: (i) The bolometric
luminosity of ultrafast AGN flares is dominated by the inverse Compton (IC)
emission, as the lower energy synchrotron emission is suppressed due to the
pitch angle anisotropy. (ii) If the observed luminosity includes a non-flaring
component, the variations of the synchrotron luminosity have a small amplitude.
(iii) The synchrotron and IC emission are less variable at lower frequencies,

translation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to CT is an alternative but

Specifically, the null-space content of the one-step denoising result is
refined by the MRI-guided data distribution prior, and its range-space

adjust the projection number of CT a posteriori for a particular clinical

radiation-induced DNA damage in the cell nucleus can undergo different pathways
to either repair or lead to cell inactivation. The main novelty of the work is
to rigorously define a spatial model that considers the pairwise interaction of
lesions and continuous protracted irradiation. The former is relevant from a
biological point of view as clustered lesions are less likely to be repaired,
leading thus to cell inactivation. The latter instead describes the effects of
a continuous radiation field on biological tissue. We prove the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to the above stochastic systems, characterizing its
probabilistic properties. We further couple the model describing the biological
system to a set of reaction-diffusion equations with random discontinuity that
model the chemical environment. At last, we study the large system limit of the
process. The developed model can be applied to different contexts, with

of waves, and it is important to quantify the wave energy density and growth
rate for understanding what type of wave instabilities are possible in
different plasma regimes. There are many situations throughout the universe
where plasmas contain a significant fraction of relativistic particles.
Theoretical estimates for the wave energy density and growth rate are
constrained to either field-aligned propagation angles, or non-relativistic
considerations. Based on linear theory, we derive the analytic expressions for
the energy density and growth rate of an arbitrary resonant wave with an
arbitrary propagation angle in relativistic plasmas. For this derivation, we
calculate the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of the relativistic-plasma
dielectric tensor. We demonstrate that our analytic expression for the wave
energy density presents an explicit energy increase of resonant waves in the
wavenumber range where the analytic expression for the growth rate is positive

numerically analyse the loss-cone driven instability, as a specific example, in
which the whistler-mode waves scatter relativistic electrons into the loss cone
in the radiation belt. Our analytic results further develop the basis for
linear theory to better understand the wave instability, and have the potential

The Shapes of Stellar Spectra,,[{'name': 'Carlos Allende Prieto'}],,2023-03-25T03:04:29Z,"Stellar atmospheres separate the hot and dense stellar interiors from the
emptiness of space. Radiation escapes from the outermost layers of a star,
carrying direct physical information. Underneath the atmosphere, the very high
opacity keeps radiation thermalized and resembling a black body with the local
temperature. In the atmosphere the opacity drops, and radiative energy leaks
out, which is redistributed in wavelength according to the physical processes
by which matter and radiation interact, in particular photoionization. In this
article, I will evaluate the role of photoionization in shaping the stellar
energy distribution of stars. To that end, I employ simple, state-of-the-art
plane-parallel model atmospheres and a spectral synthesis code, dissecting the
effects of photoionization from different chemical elements and species, for
stars of different masses in the range of 0.3 to 2 M$_{\odot}$. I examine and
interpret the changes in the observed spectral energy distributions of the
stars as a function of the atmospheric parameters. The photoionization of
atomic hydrogen and H$^-$ are the most relevant contributors to the continuum
opacity in the optical and near-infrared regions, while heavier elements become
important in the ultraviolet region. In the spectra of the coolest stars
(spectral types M and later), the continuum shape from photoionization is no
longer recognizable due to the accumulation of lines, mainly from molecules.

transition regions give rise to a signature in specific seismic indicators,
opening the possibility to constrain the physics of convection to radiation
transition. Among those seismic indicators, the ratios of the small to large
frequency separation for $l=0$ and $1$ modes ($r_{010}$) were shown to be
particularly efficient to probe these transition regions. Interestingly, in the
Kepler Legacy F-type stars, the oscillatory signatures left in the $r_{010}$
ratios by the sharp sound-speed variation have unexpected large amplitudes that
still need to be explained. We show that the signature of the bottom of the
convective envelope is amplified in the ratios $r_{010}$ by the frequency
dependence of the amplitude compared to the signal seen in the frequencies
themselves or the second differences. We find that among the different options
of physical input investigated here, large amplitude signatures can only be
obtained when convective penetration of the surface convective zone into the
underlying radiative region is taken into account. In this case and even for
amplitudes as large as those observed in F-type stars, the oscillating
signature in the ratios can only be detected when the convective envelope is
deep enough. This deep extension of the convective envelope causes doubt that
the origin of the large amplitudes is due to penetrative convection as it is
modelled here or implies that current stellar modelling (without penetrative
convection) leads to an underestimation of the size of convective envelopes. In
any case, studying the glitch signatures of a large number of oscillating
F-type stars opens the possibility to constrain the physics of the stellar

manifestations of drastic release of energy in the magnetic field, which are
related to many eruptive phenomena from the Earth magnetosphere to black hole
accretion disks. With the availability of high-resolution magnetograms on the
solar surface, observational data-based modelling is a promising way to
quantitatively study the underlying physical mechanisms behind observations. By
incorporating thermal conduction and radiation losses in the energy equation,
we develop a new data-driven radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which
has the capability to capture the thermodynamic evolution compared to our
previous zero-\b{eta} model. Our numerical results reproduce major
observational characteristics of the X1.0 flare on 2021 October 28 in NOAA

of flare ribbons, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiations, and two components of
the EUV waves predicted by the magnetic stretching model, i.e., a fast-mode
shock wave and a slower apparent wave due to successive stretching of magnetic
field lines. Moreover, some intriguing phenomena are revealed in the
simulation. We find that flare ribbons separate initially and ultimately stop
at the outer stationary quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). Such outer QSLs
correspond to the border of the filament channel and determine the final
positions of flare ribbons, which can be used to predict the size and the
lifetime of a flare before it occurs. In addition, the side view of the
synthesized EUV and white-light images exhibit typical three-part structures of
CMEs, where the bright leading front is roughly cospatial with the non-wave

`missing track searches' at the collider seems to confine fermion triplet DM
mass within a narrow range around 1 TeV. The canonical picture of pure triplet
fermionic DM is in tension since it is under-abundant for the said mass range.
Several preceding studies have shown that the existence of an extra species
over the radiation background, prior to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, leads to
a fast expanding Universe driven by an enhanced Hubble parameter. This faster
(than radiation) expansion has the potential to revive the under-abundant
fermion triplet ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd) WIMP dark matter scenario by causing
freeze-out earlier without modifying the interaction strength between DM and
thermal bath. Although the CP asymmetry, produced due to the decay of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ even heavier generations of the triplet, remains unaffected by
the modification of cosmology, the evolution of the same receives significant
non-trivial effect. It has been observed through numerical estimations that the
minimum mass of the decaying triplet, required to produce sufficient baryon
asymmetry, can be lowered up to two orders (compared to the standard cosmology)
in this fast expansion scenario. The non-standard parameters $n$ and $T_r$,
which simultaneously control the DM relic abundance as well the frozen value of
baryon asymmetry, are tightly constrained due to consecutive imposition of
experimental bounds on relic density followed by observed value of baryon
asymmetry of the Universe. It has been found that $n$ is strictly bounded
within the interval $0.4\lesssim n \lesssim 1.6$. The upper bound is imposed by
the baryon asymmetry constraint whereas the lower bound arises to satisfy the
correct relic abundance of the DM. The restriction on $T_r$ is not so stringent
as it can vary from sub GeV to few tens of GeV.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13950v1,"[{'term': 'hep-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

safety-critical tasks, it is necessary to evaluate their robustness against
adversarial examples in the real world. However, current few physical infrared
attacks are complicated to implement in practical application because of their
complex transformation from digital world to physical world. To address this
issue, in this paper, we propose a physically feasible infrared attack method
called ""adversarial infrared patches"". Considering the imaging mechanism of
infrared cameras by capturing objects' thermal radiation, adversarial infrared
patches conduct attacks by attaching a patch of thermal insulation materials on
the target object to manipulate its thermal distribution. To enhance
adversarial attacks, we present a novel aggregation regularization to guide the
simultaneous learning for the patch' shape and location on the target object.
Thus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We
verify adversarial infrared patches in different object detection tasks with
various object detectors. Experimental results show that our method achieves
more than 90\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) versus the pedestrian detector and
vehicle detector in the physical environment, where the objects are captured in
different angles, distances, postures, and scenes. More importantly,
adversarial infrared patch is easy to implement, and it only needs 0.5 hours to
be constructed in the physical world, which verifies its effectiveness and

Hider picks a point to hide on the tree and a Searcher picks a unit speed
trajectory starting at the root. The payoff (to the Hider) is the search time.
In Gal's model (and many subsequent investigations), the Searcher receives no
additional information after the Hider chooses his location. In reality, the
Searcher will often receive such locational information. For homeland security,
mobile sensors on vehicles have been used to locate radioactive material
stashed in an urban environment. In a military setting, mobile sensors can
detect chemical signatures from land mines. In predator-prey search, the
predator often has specially attuned senses (hearing for wolves, vision for
eagles, smell for dogs, sonar for bats, pressure sensors for sharks) that may
help it locate the prey. How can such noisy locational information be used by
the Searcher to modify her route? We model such information as signals which
indicate which of two branches of a binary tree should be searched first, where
the signal has a known accuracy p<1. Our solution calculates which branch (at
every branch node) is favored, meaning it should always be searched first when
the signal is in that direction. When the signal is in the other direction, we

motion around a larger companion of $M_\star \simeq 0.5$ M$_{\odot}$ at a
separation of 30-40 au. The measured luminosities of the knots using the

typical for low-mass driving sources. While the brightness asymmetry between
the redshifted and blueshifted lobes is consistent with external irradiation,
further analysis of the [NiII] and [FeII] lines suggests that photoionization
of the jet is not likely to be a dominant factor, and that the emission is
dominated by collisional excitation. The dynamical age of the jet compared to
the anticipated survival time of the proplyd demonstrates that photoevaporation
of the proplyd occurred prior to jet launching, and that this is still an
active source. These two points suggest that the envelope of the proplyd may
shield the jet from the majority of external radiation, and that
photoionization of the proplyd does not appear to impact the ability of a star

withstand the accumulation of the radiation induced disorder. Based on the
magnitudes of such disorder levels, semiconductors are commonly grouped into
the low- or high-radiation tolerant. Nevertheless, upon exposing to
sufficiently high fluences, in all cases known by far, it ends up with either
extremely high disorder levels or amorphization. Here we show that gamma/beta
double polymorph Ga2O3 structures exhibit unprecedently high radiation
tolerance. Specifically, for room temperature experiments, they tolerate a
disorder equivalent to hundreds of displacements per atom, without severe
degradations of crystallinity; in comparison with, e.g., Si amorphizable
already with the lattice atoms displaced just once. We explain this behavior by
an interesting combination of the Ga- and O-sublattice properties in
gamma-Ga2O3. In particular, O-sublattice exhibits a strong recrystallization
trend to recover the face-centered-cubic stacking despite high mobility of O
atoms in collision cascades compared to Ga. Concurrently, the characteristic
structure of the Ga-sublattice is nearly insensitive to the accumulated
disorder. Jointly it explains macroscopically negligible structural
deformations in gamma-Ga2O3 observed in experiment. Notably, we also explained
the origin of the beta-to-gamma Ga2O3 transformation, as a function of
increased disorder in beta-Ga2O3 and studied the phenomena as a function of the
chemical nature of the implanted atoms. As a result, we conclude that
gamma-beta double polymorph Ga2O3 structures, in terms of their radiation
tolerance properties, benchmark a new class of universal radiation tolerant

POLARIS dust radiative transfer tool, which includes dust alignment with
Radiative Torques Alignment (RATs). We test how the polarized dust emission
from the model core depends on the irradiation conditions in the protostellar

the central protostellar embryo throughout the envelope. The level of grain
alignment efficiency obtained in the radiative transfer models is then compared

Our radiative transfer calculations have a central irradiation that reproduces
the protostellar luminosities typically observed towards low- to
intermediate-mass protostars, as well as super-paramagnetic grains, and grains
>10 micron, which are required to bring the dust grain alignment efficiencies
of the synthetic observations up to observed levels. Our radiative transfer

providing us with a way to indirectly detect dark matter (DM). Dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) galaxies are excellent places to search for annihilation signals because
they are rich in DM and background emission is low. If magnetic fields in dSph
galaxies exist, the particles produced in DM annihilation emit synchrotron
radiation. We used the non-detection of 150 MHz radio continuum emission from
dSph galaxies with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the
annihilation cross section of WIMPs in electron-positron pairs. Our main
underlying assumption is that the transport of the cosmic rays can be described
by the diffusion approximation, which necessitates the existence of magnetic
fields. We used observations of six dSph galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky
Survey (LoTSS). The data were reimaged and radial profiles were generated. We
also used stacking to increase the sensitivity. In order to derive upper limits
on the WIMP cross section, we injected fake Gaussian sources into the data,
which were then detected with 2$\sigma$ significance in the radial profile.
These sources represent the lowest emission we would have been able to detect.
We present limits from the observations of individual galaxies as well as from
stacking. We explored the uncertainty due to the choice of diffusion and
magnetic field parameters by constructing three different model scenarios:
optimistic (OPT), intermediate (INT), and pessimistic (PES). Assuming
monochromatic annihilation into electron-positron pairs, the limits from the
INT scenario exclude thermal WIMPs below 20 GeV, and the limits from the OPT
scenario even exclude thermal WIMPs below 70 GeV. The INT limits can compete
with limits set by Fermi-LAT using $\gamma$-ray observations of multiple dwarf
galaxies, and they are especially strong for low WIMP masses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12155v2,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

the H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratio and the ionization parameter, log q. As all three
are expected to decrease as the stellar population ages, this could indicate
that we observe an evolutionary sequence. This interpretation is further
supported by correlations between all three properties. Interpreting these as
evolutionary tracers, we find younger nebulae to be more attenuated by dust and
closer to giant molecular clouds, in line with recent models of
feedback-regulated star formation. We also observe strong correlations with the
local metallicity variations and all three proposed age tracers, suggestive of

temperature remains a few thousand Kelvin, and the radiative feedback by
ionizing photons is too weak to disturb the accretion flow up to the epoch
examined in this work. In the turbulent case, the protostar rotates rapidly at
more than 0.4 times the Keplerian velocity owing to the angular momentum
provided by the initial turbulence. The protostar approximates an oblate

A modified projection approach to line mixing,,[{'name': 'Sven Nordebo'}],,2023-03-21T09:22:00Z,"This paper presents a simple approach to combine the high-resolution
narrowband features of some desired isolated line models together with the far
wing behavior of the projection based strong collision (SC) method to line
mixing which was introduced by Bulanin, Dokuchaev, Tonkov and Filippov. The
method can be viewed in terms of a small diagonal perturbation of the SC
relaxation matrix providing the required narrowband accuracy close to the line
centers at the same time as the SC line coupling transfer rates are retained
and can be optimally scaled to thermalize the radiator after impact. The method
can conveniently be placed in the framework of the Boltzmann-Liouville
transport equation where a rigorous diagonalization of the line mixing problem
requires that molecular phase and velocity changes are assumed to be
uncorrelated. A detailed analysis for the general Doppler case is given based
on the first order Rosenkranz approximation, and which also provides the
possibility to incorporate quadratically speed dependent parameters. Exact
solutions for pure pressure broadening and explicit Rosenkranz approximations

Squeezing of the quantum electromagnetic vacuum,,[{'name': 'Karol Gietka'}],,2023-03-21T06:57:20Z,"It is commonly agreed that the electromagnetic vacuum is not empty but filled

emission. Here we argue that if the vacuum has virtual photons it might mean
that it is very weakly squeezed and therefore the electromagnetic field is not
in its ground state (vacuum) but in an excited dark state. We suggest a
stringent test relying on measuring various properties of the electromagnetic
field to exclude this yet-untested squeezing hypothesis. This could be done by
measuring the number of photons as a function of frequency and comparing it
with the spectrum of electric (or magnetic) field fluctuations. If such
squeezing exists, it might shed new light on cosmological phase transitions and
give complementary information to the observed microwave background radiation

non-perturbative particle production in static or quasi-static systems.
Unravelling the local nature of the Stokes phenomenon and discriminating

decreases with the energy flux ($F$). A tight $E_{\rm p}\propto F^{0.54}$

function over a linear function in log-linear space. We call this particular

remains challenging because of the severe decay of the interaction with spatial
distance. In light of the emerging gain-driven polartion, here we show that
this paradigm can be breached if the system damping is compensated by a gain.
Consequently, a meter-scale-strong photon-magnon coupling at room temperature

control photon-magnon coupling by modulating the phases and amplitudes of
traveling waves, rather than reconfiguring subsystems themselves following

compatibility with known GRB energy and luminosity distributions. Our analysis
indicates that the energy/luminosity function of GRBs is consistent across

expected energy/luminosity functions within $\sim 2\sigma$ Poisson fluctuation

Furthermore, we find that GRB 221009A and other energetic bursts, defined as

medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we develop a multiple decoder
U-net architecture where a noisy auxiliary decoder is used to generate noisy
segmentation. The segmentation from the main branch and the noisy segmentation
from the auxiliary branch are used together to estimate the attention. Our
contribution is the development of a new attention module which derives the
attention from the softmax probabilities of two decoder branches. The union and
intersection of two segmentation masks from two branches carry the information
where both decoders agree and disagree. The softmax probabilities from regions
of agreement and disagreement are the indicators of low and high uncertainty.
Thus, the probabilities of those selected regions are used as attention in the
bottleneck layer of the encoder and passes only through the main decoder for
segmentation. For accurate contour segmentation, we also developed a CT
intensity integrated regularization loss. We tested our model on two publicly
available OAR challenge datasets, Segthor and LCTSC respectively. We trained 12
models on each dataset with and without the proposed attention model and
regularization loss to check the effectiveness of the attention module and the

technique for monitoring the skin's conditions, early detection of the human
skin cancer, and recovery from burns and wounds. It can be applied for
visualization of healing process directly through clinical dressings and
restorative ointments, minimizing the frequency of dressing changes. The THz
imaging technique is cost effective, as compared to the magnetic resonance
method. Our aim was to develop an approach capable of providing better image
resolution than the commercially available THz imaging cameras. Approach: The
terahertz-to-infrared (THz-to-IR) converters can visualize the human skin
cancer by converting the latter's specific contrast patterns recognizable in
THz radiation range into IR patterns, detectable by a standard IR imaging
camera. At the core of suggested THz-to-IR converters are flat matrices
transparent both in the THz range to be visualized and in the operating range
of the IR camera; these matrices contain embedded metal nanoparticles, which,
when irradiated with THz rays, convert the energy of THz photons into heat and
become nanosources of IR radiation detectable by an IR camera. Results: The
ways of creating the simplest converter, as well as a more complex converter
with wider capabilities, are considered. The first converter is a gelatin
matrix with gold 8.5 nm diameter nanoparticles, the second is a polystyrene
matrix with 2 nm diameter nanoparticles from copper-nickel MONEL (c) alloy 404.
Conclusions: An approach with a THz-to-IR converter equipped with an IR camera

to be caused by radiation pressure due to the absorption and scattering of the
stellar radiation by the dust grains formed in the atmosphere. The optical
properties of dust are often estimated using the small particle limit (SPL)
approximation, and it has been used frequently in modelling AGB stellar winds
when performing radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations. We aim to
investigate the effects of replacing the SPL approximation by detailed Mie
calculations of the size-dependent opacities for grains of amorphous carbon
forming in C-rich AGB star atmospheres. We performed RHD simulations for a
large grid of carbon star atmosphere+wind models with different effective
temperatures, luminosities, stellar masses, carbon excesses, and pulsation
properties. Also, a posteriori radiative transfer calculations for many radial
structures (snapshots) of these models were done, resulting in spectra and
filter magnitudes. We find, when giving up the SPL approximation, the wind
models become more strongly variable and more dominated by gusts, although the
average mass-loss rates and outflow speeds do not change significantly; the
increased radiative pressure on the dust throughout its formation zone does,
however, result in smaller grains and lower condensation fractions (and thus
higher gas-to-dust ratios). The photometric K magnitudes are generally
brighter, but at V the effects of using size-dependent dust opacities are more
complex: brighter for low mass-loss rates and dimmer for massive stellar winds.

hidden objects/defects in materials, as they can penetrate through most
optically-opaque materials. However, existing terahertz inspection systems are
restricted in their throughput and accuracy (especially for detecting small
features) due to their limited speed and resolution. Furthermore, machine
vision-based continuous sensing systems that use large-pixel-count imaging are
generally bottlenecked due to their digital storage, data transmission and
image processing requirements. Here, we report a diffractive processor that
rapidly detects hidden defects/objects within a target sample using a
single-pixel spectroscopic terahertz detector, without scanning the sample or
forming/processing its image. This terahertz processor consists of passive
diffractive layers that are optimized using deep learning to modify the
spectrum of the terahertz radiation according to the absence/presence of hidden
structures or defects. After its fabrication, the resulting diffractive
processor all-optically probes the structural information of the sample volume
and outputs a spectrum that directly indicates the presence or absence of
hidden structures, not visible from outside. As a proof-of-concept, we trained
a diffractive terahertz processor to sense hidden defects (including
subwavelength features) inside test samples, and evaluated its performance by
analyzing the detection sensitivity as a function of the size and position of
the unknown defects. We validated its feasibility using a single-pixel
terahertz time-domain spectroscopy setup and 3D-printed diffractive layers,
successfully detecting hidden defects using pulsed terahertz illumination. This

common models. The Marangoni effect was applied as a velocity boundary

thermal boundary conditions. As specific models to EML, the Lorentz force, and
Joule heat were calculated based on the analytical solution of the

their lives as a white dwarf (WD) star. In this evolutionary stage, WDs enter
the cooling sequence, where the stars radiate away their thermal energy, and
are basically cooling. As these stars cool, they reach temperatures and
conditions that cause the stars to pulsate. Using differential photometry to
produce light curves, we can determine the observed periods of pulsation from
the WD. We used the White Dwarf Evolution Code (WDEC) to calculate a grid of

emerge in artificial networks as long as (i) the retina converts the input
radiation into any tristimulus-like representation, and (ii) the post-retinal
network solves the standard hue cancellation task, e.g. the network looks for
the weights of the cancelling lights so that every monochromatic stimulus plus
the weighted cancelling lights match a grey reference in the (arbitrary) color
representation used by the network. In fact, the specific cancellation lights
(and not the network architecture) are key to obtain human-like curves: results
show that the classical choice of the lights is the one that leads to the best

psychophysics using a range of networks with different architectures and a
range of cancellation lights, and through a change-of-basis theoretical analogy

design aperture field for the desired phaseless radiation pattern, from the

polarization constraint. Specifically, the inverse design can be converted into
solving the first kind of Fredholm integral equation, using the spectral domain
method. To deal with the ill-posedness of such integral equation, we apply
modal expansion to the integrand. To cope with the non-linearity introduced by
phaseless, we use a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the
coefficients in the modal expansion. Finally, we use this method to break the
cosine rule that the directivity of 2D arrays drops as cosine of the angle,
which is a puzzle in wide-angle scanning. The numerical simulation results meet

forming due to a sudden pressure drop and is often accompanied by increased
hull vibrations, increased radiated noise and decrease in propeller and
impeller performance. Although the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
method coupled with a cavitation model is still considered a practical tool to
predict cavitating flows owing to its computational efficiency, it is unable to
predict the unsteadiness of vapor shedding and over-predicts the eddy
viscosity. To improve the prediction, an empirical eddy viscosity
correction,[Reboud et al. 1998] was proposed to consider the compressibility
effects produced by cavitation. Additionally, a new type of models termed as
hybrid RANS-Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models have also been recently
introduced in the community, having the ability to behave as a RANS or a LES
model in different regions of the flow in order to combine the computational
cost efficiency of RANS with the accuracy of LES modelling. However, there
exists a lack of a comprehensive review of various such turbulence models like
the k-{\omega} Shear Stress Transport Model (SST), k-{\omega} SST
Scale-adaptive Simulation (SAS), k-{\omega} SST Detached Eddy Simulation (DES),
k-{\omega} SST Delayed DES (DDES), Filter-Based Method (FBM) and
Partially-Averaged Navier Stokes Method (PANS) to predict cavitating flows. In
this work, we conduct such a review to compare their ability to predict cloud
cavitating flows by comparing them with x-ray experimental data in a venturi.
It is shown that with mesh refinement, standard models do show the vapor
unsteadiness as seen in the experiment similar to that seen when using the
Reboud correction. However, on local comparison of turbulence quantities, it is
observed both forms of models have huge discrepancies with experimental data
that does not improve downstream.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08285v1,"[{'term': 'physics.flu-dyn', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our
investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances
on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely
radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost)
scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak
mass of $M_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M_{\odot}$ of which a fraction $f\approx
1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs have a mass of $M_{\rm pbh} > 10 M_{\odot}$,
possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point
out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is

Extracting the energy and angular momentum of a Kerr black hole,,"[{'name': 'J. A. Rueda'}, {'name': 'R. Ruffini'}]",,2023-03-14T10:06:28Z,"It has been thought for decades that rotating black holes (BHs) power the
energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the
mechanism that extracts the BH energy has remained elusive. We here show that
the solution to this problem arises when the BH is immersed in an external
magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to
the BH spin, the induced electric field accelerates electrons outward and
protons inward at spherical polar angles $-60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim
60^\circ$ (hereafter polar region), and vice versa at $60^\circ\lesssim \theta
\lesssim 120^\circ$ (hereafter equatorial region). For an antiparallel magnetic
field, protons and electrons exchange their roles. The particles that are
accelerated outward radiate off energy and angular momentum to infinity. The BH
powers the process by reducing its energy and angular momentum by capturing
polar protons and equatorial electrons with net negative energy and angular
momentum. The electric potential allows for negative energy states outside the
BH ergosphere, so the latter does not play any role in this electrodynamical BH
energy extraction process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07760v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

enabled by broadband low-frequency radio observations. By Faraday tomography,
it is possible to obtain the Faraday dispersion function which contains
information on the line-of-sight distributions of magnetic fields, thermal
electron density, and cosmic-ray electron density by measuring the polarization
spectrum from a source of synchrotron radiation over a wide band. Furthermore,
by combining it with 2-dimensional imaging, Faraday tomography allows us to
explore the 3-dimensional structure of polarization sources. The application of
Faraday tomography has been active in the last 20 years, when broadband
observation has become technically feasible. However, the Faraday dispersion
function is mathematically the Fourier transform of the polarization spectrum,
and since the observable band is finite, it is impossible to obtain a complete
Faraday dispersion function by performing Fourier transform. In addition, the
Faraday dispersion function does not directly reflect the distribution of
magnetic field, thermal-electron density, and cosmic-ray electron density in
the physical space, and its physical interpretation is not straightforward.
Despite these two difficult problems, Faraday tomography is attracting much
attention because it has great potential as a new method for studying cosmic
magnetic fields and magnetized plasmas. In particular, the next-generation
radio telescope SKA (Square Kilometre Array) is capable of polarization
observation with unprecedented sensitivity and broad bands, and the application
of Faraday tomography is expected to make dramatic progress in the field of
cosmic magnetic fields. In this review, we explain the basics of Faraday
tomography with simple and instructive examples. Then representative algorithms
to realize Faraday tomography are introduced and finally some applications are

A Model of EUV Emission from Clusters of Galaxies,,"[{'name': 'Richard Lieu'}, {'name': 'Chun-Hui Shi'}]",10.1093/mnras/stad815,2023-03-13T20:31:17Z,"With tantalizing evidence of the recent e-Rosita mission, re-discovering very
soft X-rays and EUV radiation from a cluster of galaxies or its environment,
the question of the origin of cluster EUV excess is revisited in this work. It
will be shown that the gas temperature, density, and frozen-in magnetic field
of the intracluster medium, collectively support the emission and propagation
of coherent \u{C}erenkov radiation, which is low frequency and large amplitude
radiation capable of accelerating charged particles to relativistic speeds.
Owing to the spectrum of \u{C}erenkov radiation, most of the incipient
relativistic electrons undergo inverse-Compton scattering with the cosmic
microwave background. It turns out the scattered radiation has observable
ramifications only in the EUV band, of photon energy $70 -- 100$~eV, having a
luminosity $\approx 10^{44}$~ergs~s$^{-1}$. This luminosity is on par with the
EUV excess level detected from Abell 1795 and the Coma cluster. It should be
stressed, as {\it caveat emptor}, that although the main subject is the
putative large amplitude coherent \u{C}erenkov modes which are highly
nonlinear, the results presented were derived using a quasi-linear approach to
highlight the observable features of the phenomenon, namely the EUV emission.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07412v2,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"
Perturbations of Fefferman spaces over CR three-manifolds,,[{'name': 'Arman Taghavi-Chabert'}],,2023-03-13T17:48:02Z,"We introduce a generalisation of Fefferman's conformal circle bundle over a
contact Cauchy--Riemann three-manifold. These can be viewed as exact
`perturbations' of Fefferman's structure by a semi-basic one-form, which
encodes additional data on the CR three-manifold.
  We find conditions on the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor for a Lorentzian
conformal four-manifold equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of
null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed
Fefferman space.
  We investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed Fefferman conformal
class satisfying appropriate sub-conditions of the Einstein equations, such as
the so-called pure radiation equations. These metrics are defined only off
cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in
terms of densities that generalise Gover's notion of almost Einstein scales.
Our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the Ricci tensor to the
underlying CR three-manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex
density and the CR data of the perturbation one-form. One such constraint turns
out to arise from a non-linear, or gauged, analogue of a second-order
differential operator on densities. A solution thereof provides a criterion for
the existence of a CR function and, under certain conditions, for the
realisability of the CR three-manifold. These findings are consistent with
previous works by Lewandowski, Nurowski, Tafel, Hill, and independently, by
Mason.
  We also provide an analysis of the Weyl curvature of such conformal
structures in terms of the underlying CR data. In particular, we arrive at a CR
formulation of the asymptotic Einstein condition by viewing conformal infinity
as a cross-section of Fefferman's circle bundle.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07328v1,"[{'term': 'math.DG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.MP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'Primary 53C18, 32V05, 53C50, 83C15, Secondary 32V10, 32V30, 53B30', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. To extract the atomic and molecular
hydrogen properties of the simulated galaxy population, postprocessing methods

studies by calculating realistic UV fields with the dust radiative transfer
code SKIRT to model the atomic-to-molecular transition in TNG50, the
highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG suite. Comparing integrated
quantities such as the HI mass function, we study to what detail the UV field

then evaluate new, spatially resolved comparisons for cold gas in galaxies by
exploring synthetic maps of atomic hydrogen at redshift zero and compare them
to 21-cm observations of local galaxies from the WHISP survey. In terms of
non-parametric morphologies, we find that TNG50 HI maps are less concentrated
than their WHISP counterparts (median $\Delta C\approx0.3$), due in part to
central HI deficits related to the ejective character of supermassive black
hole feedback in TNG. In terms of the HI column density distribution function,
we find discrepancies between WHISP and IllustrisTNG that depend on the total
HI abundance in these datasets as well as the postprocessing method. To fully

they bend light, how they emit radiation, and how they appear as a shadow by
considering a thin accretion disk model. We initially examine the overall
behavior of the photonsphere and the corresponding shadow silhouette under the
effects of these parameters. Using the EHT data for Sgr. A* and M87*, we aim to
find constraints for $q_m$. Our results indicate that M87* gives better
constraints, and as the value of $\beta$ is varied to increase, the constrained
range for $q_m$ widens. At lower values of $q_m$, we find that the shadow
radius is close to the observed value. Then, we study different things like how
much energy the black hole emits, the temperature of the disk around it, and
the kind of light it gives off. We also look at how the black hole shadow
appears in different situations. We also study how matter falls onto the black
hole from all directions. Finally, we investigate how the magnetic charge
affects all these things when we take into account a theory called NLED along

The observations were performed with the GMOS-IFU on the Gemini North
telescope, resulting in a spatial resolution of $\sim725$ pc at the distance of
the galaxy. While the stars present ordered rotation following the orientation
of the large scale disc, the gas shows a disturbed kinematics. The
emission-line profiles present two kinematic components: a narrow
($\sigma\lesssim200$ km s$^{-1}$) component associated with the gas in the disc
of the galaxy and a broad ($\sigma\gtrsim200$ km s$^{-1}$) component produced
by gas outflows. Emission-line ratio diagrams indicate that the gas in the disc
is excited by the AGN radiation field, while the emission of the outflow
includes additional contribution of shock excitation due to the interaction of
the radio jet with the environment gas. Deviations from pure rotation, of up to
30 km s$^{-1}$, are observed in the disc component and likely produced by a
previous merger event. The broad component is blueshifted by $\sim150-500$ km
s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy in all locations. We
construct radial profiles of the mass outflow rate and kinetic power of the

using the memories kept in a quantum field to decipher certain information
about the early universe. As a model study, we let a massless quantum field be
subjected to a parametric process for a finite time interval such that the mode
frequency of the field transits from one constant value to another. This
configuration mimics a statically-bounded universe, but not a continuously
evolving one. The field squeezed by this process should contain information of
the process itself. If an atom is coupled to the field after the parametric
process, its response will depend on the squeezing, and any quantum radiation
emitted by the atom will carry this information away so that an observer at a
much later time may still identify it. Our analyses show that 1) a remote
observer cannot measure the generated squeezing via the radiation energy flux
from the atom because the net radiation energy flux is canceled. However, 2)
there is a chance to identify squeezing by measuring the constant radiation
energy density at late times. The only restriction is that this energy density
is of the near-field nature. The second part of this paper focuses on 3) the
dependence of squeezing on the functional form of the parametric process. Via
several examples we demonstrate that the behavior of squeezing reflect
essential properties of the parametric process. In fact, striking features may
show up in complicated processes involving various scales. These analyses allow
us to establish the connection between properties of a squeezed quantum field
and the parametric process which does the squeezing. Therefore, 4) one can
construct templates to reconstitute the unknown parametric processes from the
data of measurable quantities subjected to squeezing. In a sequel paper these
results will be applied to a study of quantum radiations in cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06831v1,"[{'term': 'quant-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'hep-th', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

sample of major flares (S > 1 Jy). We find that the minor flares have rise
times and duration of ~ 1 hour, as opposed to ~ days for the major flares.
Minor flares show more rapid expansion of the synchrotron radiation emitting
material than in the strong flares. They also appear closer to the binary,
whereas the large flares form a more developed jet, i.e. the jets formed in
minor flares are short and wide, those in major flares are long and thin. We
used the results of Fender & Bright (2019) to calculate the magnetic field and
expansion velocity as a fraction B of the speed of light under minimum energy
conditions when the source is optically thick for samples of minor and major
flares. The minimum power in the source was found using the rise time of the
flares. The minor flares have lower minimum power but have larger velocities
and energy densities than the major flares. Minor flares can occur while a
major flare is in progress, suggesting an indirect coupling between them. The
spectral evolution of the minor flares can be explained by either an expanding
synchrotron source or a shock model. Further investigation requires high

development of the source. The problem is that Cygnus X-3 is strongly scattered

recent years, it has been increasingly used in research on particle dynamics.
Previous studies focused on quantifying the effects of curvature scattering in
a single case. This paper uses the analytic model to calculate the spatial
distribution of diffusion coefficients induced by FLCS in a real magnetic field
model. Various energy particles are used to analyze the coverage of curvature
scattering in radial and MLT directions, as well as the influence of $Kp$
index. The decay time of particles due to curvature scattering is estimated
based on diffusion coefficients which suggest that the time scale of curvature
scattering is too long to explain the rapid loss of electrons in the radiation
belt and the ring current with the energy of MeV or below MeV. However, the
decay time of ring current protons is on the order of hours or even minutes
which can be used to explain the ring current decay during the recovery phase

reduce radiation dose and benefit clinical applications. Previous voxel-based
generation methods represent the CT as discrete voxels, resulting in high
memory requirements and limited spatial resolution due to the use of 3D

field and develop a novel DIF-Net to perform high-quality CBCT reconstruction
from extremely sparse (fewer than 10) projection views at an ultrafast speed.
The intensity field of a CT can be regarded as a continuous function of 3D

the intensity value of an arbitrary 3D point from given sparse projections.
Specifically, for a point, DIF-Net extracts its view-specific features from
different 2D projection views. These features are subsequently aggregated by a
fusion module for intensity estimation. Notably, thousands of points can be
processed in parallel to improve efficiency during training and testing. In
practice, we collect a knee CBCT dataset to train and evaluate DIF-Net.

materialized by higher order non-renormalizable dimension six and dimension
eight operators, active at a scale M of the order 20-100TeV. This new physics
scale M which is way higher than the electroweak scale, is motivated by the
lack of new particle observations in the large hadron collider to date, beyond
the electroweak scale. Once the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs at T\sim

generated by the electroweak breaking, and the axion oscillations at the origin

rolls swiftly to its new minimum, experiencing a short kination epoch, where
its energy density redshifts as $\rho_a\sim a^{-6}$. After it reaches the new

the Higgs minimum. The axion returns to the origin and commences again
oscillations initiated by quantum fluctuations, redshifts as dark matter, and

high accuracy, making it appealing to clinical problems such as radiation

challenge leading to model brittleness to small shifts to input data. Most

interpretability of the boundaries of the training data distribution during
training, which is essential for model deployment in clinical practice. We
propose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable
segmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an
explorable manifold during training. The proposed approach creates medical
image style paired with a segmentation task driven discriminator incorporating
end-to-end adversarial training. The discriminator is generalised to small
domain shifts as much as permissible by the training data, and the generator
automatically diversifies the training samples using a manifold of input
features learnt during segmentation. All the while, the discriminator guides
the manifold learning by supervising the semantic content and fine-grained
features separately during the image diversification. After training,
visualisation of the learnt manifold from the generator is available to
interpret the model limits. Experiments on a fully semantic, publicly available

39+-8 K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both

SO2 in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources,
suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO2 formation would be
regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH3OH shows a large
abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial

thermodynamic phase transition, separating large unstable black holes from
stable configurations close to extremality. We first describe the black-hole
evaporation process using a quasistatic approximation and we show that it ends
in the extremal configuration in an infinite amount of time. We go beyond the
quasistatic approximation by numerically integrating the field equations for
$2\text{D}$ dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ massless scalar fields, describing
the radiation. We find that the inclusion of large backreaction effects ($N \gg

the quasistatic approximation and construct the relative Page curve. We find
that the EE initially grows, reaches a maximum and then goes down towards zero,
in agreement with previous results in the literature. Despite the breakdown of
the semiclassical approximation prevents the description of the evaporation
process near extremality, we have a clear indication that the end point of the

the most extended nebula for H$\alpha$ follow-up with MOSFIRE. Within the

dissociation in which the fragments can move around one another at relatively

is sufficient time for other processes to occur, which can lead to the
formation of new molecular compounds. Due to the neutral character of the
roaming fragments, they follow a rather indeterminate trajectory, thus
complicating their identification and systematic study. Here, we temporally
resolve the roaming of $H_2$ from ionized acetonitrile, $CH_3CN$. Using
intense, femtosecond IR radiation combined with coincident Coulomb explosion
imaging, we can directly reconstruct the momentum of the roaming $H_2$, thereby
gaining an unambiguous, experimental signature of roaming as well as a
kinematically complete picture of the underlying molecular dynamics. Afterward,
a portion of the neutral $H_2$ molecules forms $H_3^+$ ions, an important
cation in astrophysics, through proton transfer within a few hundred
femtoseconds. With the aid of quantum chemistry calculations, we can fully
determine how this unique dissociative process occurs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04916v1,"[{'term': 'physics.chem-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.atm-clus', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

This misses the most general behavior compatible with Lorentz symmetry. We
present a Lagrangian formalism describing interactions of matter particles with
bosonic ""continuous spin"" fields with arbitrary spin scale $\rho$. Remarkably,
physical observables are well approximated by familiar theories at frequencies
larger than $\rho$, with calculable deviations at low frequencies and long
distances. For example, we predict specific $\rho$-dependent modifications to
the Lorentz force law and the Larmor formula, which lay the foundation for
experimental tests of the photon's spin scale. We also reproduce known soft
radiation emission amplitudes for nonzero $\rho$. The particles' effective
matter currents are not fully localized to their worldlines when $\rho \neq 0$,
which motivates investigation of manifestly local completions of our theory.
Our results also motivate the development of continuous spin analogues of

extreme luminosity and long timescale of the transient disfavour the disruption

We find that the CN/HCN line ratio shows no significant correlation with
molecular gas surface density, but shows a mild trend (increase of ~ 1.3 per

1-exciton model in which processes involving weak excitations are described
using a basis comprising of the ground state and singly excited states of the

decision-making problem and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. To
facilitate the training process, a 3D-Unet is designed to predict the dose
distribution for the different number of beam angles, ranging from 1 to 9, to
simulate the IMRT environment. By leveraging the simulation model, double
deep-Q network (DDQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) are used to train
agents to select the personalized beam angle sequentially within a few seconds.
Results: The treatment plans with beam angles selected by DRL outperform those
with clinically used evenly distributed beam angles. For DDQN, the overall
average improvement of the CIs is 0.027, 0.032, and 0.03 for 5, 7, and 9 beam

astrophysically relevant characteristics (such as, dominant quasinormal modes,

a simple metric which depends on three independent parameters (coefficients of
the parametrization). Variation of these three parameters can, nevertheless,
lead to the two distinctive features. The first is the black-hole temperature,

Operating in the fast wave (radiation) region, the space-time-coded MTM antenna
is tailored in a way such that the propagation constant of each programmable
unit cell embedded with varactor diodes can toggle between positive and
negative phases, which is done through providing digital sequences by using a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Owing to the time-varying coding
sequence, harmonic frequencies are generated with different main beam
directions. Furthermore, the space time modulation of the digitally coded MTM

present the discovery of a luminous mid-IR nuclear flare (termed WTP 14adbjsh)

appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics. We aim
to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial
distribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results. In particular, we focus on using
the depolarization effect to verify the polarization model and to identify the
emission region. First, we show that wavelength-independent depolarization,
which takes into account anisotropic turbulence, does not work efficiently
because the polarized emission is stronger in regions of ordered spiral fields
than in regions dominated by isotropic turbulent fields. Beam depolarization
becomes more effective below 1 GHz. Although close to the equatorial plane
there will be strong depolarization which increases with observing wavelength,
this effect is less in the halo, making halo magnetic fields detectable through
their polarized emission at meter-wavelength bands. Although polarized emission
from the halo is below the detection limit of current facilities, it will be
detectable within the SKA era. In addition, we found that the spiral
polarization projected on a screen is produced by overlapping magnetic flux
tubes extending to different heights from the equatorial plane. This suggests
that the traditional classification of global magnetic fields has difficulty
reproducing the global structure of the magnetic fields. Finally, we
demonstrate the method to separate magnetic flux tubes at different heights by
using peak frequencies which cause the decreasing of polarized flux.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02703v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

values, of the various definitions that can be established for the dose rate in
PBS proton therapy.
  Methods: In an in silico study, five definitions of the dose rate, namely the
PBS dose rate, the percentile dose rate, the maximum percentile dose rate, the
average dose rate, and the dose averaged dose rate (DADR) were analyzed first
through theoretical comparison, and then applied to a head and neck case. To
carry out this study, a treatment plan utilizing a single energy level and
requiring the use of a patient-specific range modulator was employed. The dose
rate values were compared both locally and by means of dose rate volume
histograms (DRVHs).
  Results: The PBS dose rate, the percentile dose rate, and the maximum
percentile dose are definitions that are specifically designed to take into
account the time structure of the delivery of a PBS treatment plan. Although
they may appear similar, our study shows that they can vary locally by up to
10%. On the other hand, the DADR values were approximately twice as high as
those of the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates, since the DADR
disregards the periods when a voxel does not receive any dose. Finally, the
average dose rate can be defined in various ways, as discussed in this paper.
The average dose rate is found to be lower by a factor of approximately 1/2
than the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates.
  Conclusions: We have shown that using different definitions for the dose rate
in FLASH proton therapy can lead to variations in calculated values ranging
from a few percent to a factor of two. Since the dose rate is a critical
parameter in FLASH radiation therapy, it is essential to carefully consider the
choice of definition. However, to make an informed decision, additional
biological data and models are needed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02056v1,"[{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

consistent with the results obtained for other X-ray pulsars and is likely
related to the inverse temperature structure of the neutron star atmosphere.

forming through the direct collapse (DC) scenario by using cosmological N -body
simulations combined with a semi-analytic model for galaxy evolution. While in
most of earlier studies the occurrence of the DC is limited only in chemically
pristine halos, we here suppose that the DC can occur also in halos with
metallicity below a threshold value $Z_{\rm th} = 0$--$10^{-3}~{\rm
Z}_{\bigodot}$, considering the super-competitive accretion pathway for DC
black hole (DCBH) formation. In addition, we consider for the first time the
effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from stars within host halos, i.e.,
internal radiation. We find that, with low threshold metallicities of $Z_{\rm
th} \leq 10^{-4}~{\rm Z}_{\bigodot}$, the inclusion of internal radiation
rather reduces the number density of DCBHs from $0.2$--$0.3$ to
$0.03$--$0.06~{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. This is because star formation is suppressed due
to self-regulation, and the LW flux emitted by neighboring halos is reduced.
Only when $Z_{\rm th}$ is as high as $10^{-3}~{\rm Z}_{\bigodot}$, internal
radiation enhances the number density of DCBHs from $0.4$ to $1~{\rm
Mpc}^{-3}$, thereby decreasing the threshold halo mass above which at least one
DCBH forms from $2\times 10^{9}$ to $9\times 10^{8}~{\rm M}_{\bigodot}$. We
also find that halos with $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}$--$10^{12}~{\rm

massive degrees of freedom or hidden sectors. If it is instead measured at
higher values, it will imply a period with $\omega >1/3$. We argue that for

confinement, or trapping, of the subpulses, which leads to a stable propagation
of the pulse compound, is enabled by the nonlinear Kerr effect. Special
attention is paid to the description of the binding mechanism in terms of
attractive potential wells, induced by the refractive index changes of the
subpulses, exerted on one another through cross-phase modulation. Specifically,
we discuss nonlinear-photonics meta atoms, given by pulse compounds consisting
of a strong trapping pulse and a weak trapped pulse, for which trapped states
of low intensity are determined by a Schr\""odinger-type eigenproblem. We
discuss the rich dynamical behavior of such meta-atoms, demonstrating that an
increase of the group-velocity mismatch of both subpulses leads to an
ionization-like trapping-to-escape transition. We further demonstrate that if
both constituent pulses are of similar amplitude, molecule-like bound-states
are formed. We show that z-periodic amplitude variations permit a coupling of
these pulse compound to dispersive waves, resulting in the resonant emission of

total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a
significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\sim950$ s from
the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle

studies for more than 60 years. The luminosity of these systems are often
compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is
inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when
the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High
apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation
by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.
However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs
are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray
polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,
$\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the
direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is
obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.
Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel
around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the
opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity
exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an
extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings
reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of
the inner workings of ULX central engines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01174v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

large-format sCMOS sensor, GSENSE1516BSI, which has 4096 * 4096 pixels, each of
15 {\mu}m in size. To achieve this, three areas on the sCMOS sensor, each
consisting of 99 * 99 pixels, are chosen for the experiment. The readout noise,
conversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas
are measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated
for each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of
these pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a
significant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can
also be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum
obtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56%
statistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain
of each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed
pixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain
used in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely
eliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among
pixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be
significantly improved to 124.6 eV at 4.5 keV and 140.7 eV at 6.4 keV. This

Atmosphere and Greenhouse Gas Primer,,"[{'name': 'W. A. van Wijngaarden'}, {'name': 'W. Happer'}]",,2023-03-01T20:21:29Z,"We discuss how greenhouse gases affect radiation transfer in Earth's
atmosphere. We explain how greenhouse gases like water vapor or carbon dioxide,
differ from non-greenhouse gases like nitrogen or oxygen. Using simple
thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that a planet with sufficiently
high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere.
The planet must also develop a non-convecting stratosphere above the
tropopause. In the simplest approximation of an atmosphere that is transparent
to sunlight and has frequency-independent opacity for thermal radiation, one
can find simple formulas for the tropopause altitude, and for the altitude
profiles of pressure and temperature. The troposphere is nearly isentropic and
the stratosphere is nearly isothermal. Earth's real atmosphere is much more
complicated but it does have a troposphere and a stratosphere. Between the
surface and the tropopause the entropy per kilogram of real tropospheric air
increases slowly with altitude. The entropy increases much more rapidly with
altitude in the stratosphere. The stratosphere has a nearly isothermal lower
part and a hotter upper part due to absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation
by ozone. The thermal opacity of the real atmosphere has a complicated
frequency dependence due to the hundreds of thousands of vibration-rotation
transitions of its greenhouse molecules. Unlike the simple model where nearly
all radiation to space originates at the tropopause altitude, radiation to
space from Earth's real atmosphere originates from both the surface and all
altitudes in the troposphere. A small additional amount of radiation originates
in the stratosphere. When these complications are taken into account, model
calculations of the thermal radiation spectrum at the top of the atmosphere can
hardly be distinguished from satellite observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00808v1,"[{'term': 'physics.ao-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study
the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the
underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties. We
calculate in post-processing dynamical delays between the merger in the
simulation at the resolution limit and the actual coalescence well below the
resolution scale. We find that merging BHs are hosted in relatively massive
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$. Given that galaxy mass
is correlated with other BH and galaxy properties, BH mergers tend to also have
higher total BH mass and higher BH accretion rates than the global population
of main BHs. These differences generally disappear if the merger population is
compared with a BH population sampled with the same galaxy mass distribution as
merger hosts. Galaxy mergers can temporarily boost the BH accretion rate and
the host's star formation rate, which can remain active at the BH merger if
sub-resolution delays are not taken into account. When dynamical delays are
taken into account the burst has generally faded by the time the BHs merge. BH
spins are followed self-consistently in the simulation, under the effect of
accretion and BH mergers. We find that merging BHs have higher spins than the

Treatment planning systems (TPS) are an essential component for
simulating and optimizing a radiation therapy treatment before administering it
to the patient. It ensures that the tumor is well covered and the dose to the
healthy tissues is minimized. However, the TPS provided by commercial companies
often come with a large panel of tools, each implemented in the form of a
black-box making it difficult for researchers to use them for implementing and
testing new ideas. To address this issue, we have developed an open-source TPS.
Approach. We have developed an open-source software platform, OpenTPS
(opentps.org), to generate treatment plans for external beam radiation therapy,
and in particular for proton therapy. It is designed to be a flexible and
user-friendly platform (coded with the freely usable Python language) that can
be used by medical physicists, radiation oncologists, and other members of the
radiation therapy community to create customized treatment plans for
educational and research purposes. Result. OpenTPS includes a range of tools
and features that can be used to analyze patient anatomy, simulate the delivery
of the radiation beam, and optimize the treatment plan to achieve the desired
dose distribution. It can be used to create treatment plans for a variety of
cancer types and was designed to be extended to other treatment modalities.
Significance. A new open-source treatment planning system has been built for
research in proton therapy. Its flexibility allows an easy integration of new
techniques and customization of treatment plans. It is freely available for use
and is regularly updated and supported by a community of users and developers
who contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00365v1,"[{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

can provide clues about quantum gravity because their combination can solve the
deepest puzzles of black hole physics. Suppose that the time dimension and the
extra dimension compactified on a circle are symmetric under \emph{double Wick
rotation}, the curvature singularity would be removed due to the end of
spacetime as a smooth bubble hidden behind the event horizon. The smooth bubble
geometries can also be interpreted as microstates leading to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy because the smooth bubble geometries live in the
same region of mass and charge as the black string. In addition, by applying
the quantum extremal surface prescription, we show the emergence of the island
at late times of the black string evaporation where it is located slightly
outside the event horizon. Due to the dominant contribution of the island
configuration, the entanglement entropy of the radiation grows no longer
linearly in time but it reaches a finite value that is twice the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the leading order. This transition shows the
information preservation during the black string evaporation. Furthermore, we
calculate the Page time which determines the moment of the transition between
the linearly growing and constant behaviors of the entanglement entropy as well

signal falling into the black string.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00348v1,"[{'term': 'hep-th', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

relativistic ejections during transitions that deplete or refill the inner

Angular Momentum Fluctuations,,[{'name': 'Marcelo Schiffer'}],,2023-02-28T13:18:36Z,"In this paper, we consider angular momentum fluctuations of a Schwartzschild
black hole in thermal equilibrium with radiation which, for the sake of
simplicity is here modeled by a scalar field. Important, we do not set the
black hole angular momentum $J$ identically to zero at the outset; we allow it
to have a small value (in the sense that $J/M<<1$) and then study the
conditions for thermodynamical equilibrium; only then take the $J\rightarrow 0$
limit. We calculate the black hole's angular momentum fluctuations which turn
out to have two independent contributions: one that comes from the black hole
itself, with no respect to the radiation, and another one that arises from the
radiation. The result is astonishingly simple: the radiation contribution
depends exclusively on the cut-off proper distance from the horizon (or
equivalently, the width of the brick wall), while the black hole contribution
is proportional to its event horizon area. Accordingly, there are no strictly
static black holes in nature, they randomly rotate in all possible directions.
Since a black hole is nothing but geometry, we are dealing with geometry
fluctuations -- our results are of quantum-gravitational nature (albeit at a
semi-classical level). Interestingly enough, if we apply to the black hole
fluctuations component the (quantum) rules of angular momentum we obtain an
event horizon area quantization rule, albeit with a different spectrum from an
equally spaced area spectrum which is widely accepted in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14553v1,"[{'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

the potentially habitable environments in our Solar System. The question of
whether a liquid subsurface layer can be maintained over geological timescales

linked to that of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in which they form. The CPD
accretes material from the surrounding circumstellar disk in the vicinity of
the planet, however, the degree of chemical inheritance is unclear. We aim to
investigate the composition of ices in chemically reset or inherited
circumplanetary disks to inform interior modeling and the interpretation of in
situ measurements of icy solar system satellites, with an emphasis on the
Galilean moon system. We used a radiation-thermochemical code to produce
circumplanetary disk models and extract the ice composition from time-dependent
chemistry, incorporating gas-phase and grain-surface reactions. The initial
sublimation of ices during accretion may result in a CO2-rich ice composition.
Sublimated ammonia ice is destroyed by background radiation while drifting
towards the CPD midplane. Liberated nitrogen becomes locked in N2 due to
efficient self-shielding, leaving ices depleted of ammonia. A significant
ammonia ice component remains only when ices are inherited from the
circumstellar disk. The observed composition of the Galilean moons is
consistent with the sublimation of ices during accretion onto the CPD. In this
scenario, the Galilean moon ices are nitrogen-poor and CO2 on Callisto is
endogenous and primordial. The ice composition is significantly altered after
an initial reset of accreted circumstellar ice. The chemical history of the
Galilean moons stands in contrast to the Saturnian system, where the
composition of the moons corresponds more closely with the directly inherited

dipole moment that generally makes a finite angle with its rotation axis. As a
consequence, the emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) continuously takes
away its rotational energy. This process leads to a time decreasing angular
velocity of the star that is usually quantified in terms of its braking index.
While this simple mechanism is indeed the main reason for the spin evolution of
isolated pulsars, it may not be the only cause of this effect. Most of young
isolated pulsars present braking index values that are consistently lower than
that given by the MDR model. Working in the weak field (Newtonian) limit, we

system by allowing the star's shape to wobble around an ellipsoidal
configuration as a backreaction effect produced by the MDR emission. It is
assumed that an internal damping of the oscillations occurs, thus introducing
another form of energy loss in the system, and this phenomenon may be related
to the deviation of the braking index from the pure MDR model predictions.
Numerical calculations suggest that the average braking index for typical
isolated pulsars can be thus simply explained.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13322v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

scattering, dichroic extinction, and birefringence of aligned spheroidal dust
grains can be implemented and tested in 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
(MCRT) codes. We derive a methodology for solving the radiative transfer
equation governing the changes of the Stokes parameters in dust-enshrouded
objects. We utilize the M\""uller matrix, and the extinction, scattering,
linear, and circular polarization cross sections of spheroidal grains as well
as electrons. An established MCRT code is used and its capabilities are
extended to include the Stokes formalism. We compute changes in the
polarization state of the light by scattering, dichroic extinction, and
birefringence on spheroidal grains. The dependency of the optical depth and the
albedo on the polarization is treated. The implementation of scattering by
spheroidal grains both for random walk steps as well as for directed scattering
(peel-off) are described. The observable polarization of radiation of the
objects is determined through an angle binning method for photon packages
leaving the model space as well as through an inverse ray-tracing routine for
the generation of images. We present paradigmatic examples for which we derive
analytical solutions of the optical light polarization by spheroidal dust
particles. These tests are suited for benchmark verification of MCpol and other
such codes, and allow to quantify the numerical precision reached. We
demonstrate that MCpol is in excellent agreement to within 0.1% of the Stokes

(AFA-MI) augmentation, which forces the segmentation network to learn
out-of-distribution statistics and improve generalization and robustness to
noises. AFA-MI augmentation consists of three steps: 1) generate adversarial
noises by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on the intermediate features of the
segmentation network's encoder; 2) inject the generated adversarial noises into
the network, intentionally compromising performance; 3) optimize the network
with both clean and adversarial features. Experiments are conducted segmenting
the heart, left and right kidney, liver, left and right lung, spinal cord, and
stomach. We first evaluate the AFA-MI augmentation using nnUnet and TT-Vnet on
the test data from a public abdominal dataset and an institutional dataset. In
addition, we validate how AFA-MI affects the networks' robustness to the noisy
data by evaluating the networks with added Gaussian noises of varying
magnitudes to the institutional dataset. Network performance is quantitatively
evaluated using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for volume-based accuracy.
Also, Hausdorff Distance (HD) is applied for surface-based accuracy. On the
public dataset, nnUnet with AFA-MI achieves DSC = 0.85 and HD = 6.16
millimeters (mm); and TT-Vnet achieves DSC = 0.86 and HD = 5.62 mm. AFA-MI
augmentation further improves all contour accuracies up to 0.217 DSC score when

demonstrated to improve segmentation performance and robustness in CT

modifications to the electromagnetic Casimir energy using the Green's function,
both when the axion field is initially assumed purely time-dependent and when
the axion field configuration is a static domain wall. For the first case it
means that the oscillating axion background is taken to resemble an axion fluid
at rest in a conventional Casimir setup with two infinite parallel conducting
plates, while in the second case we evaluate the radiation pressure acting on
an axion domain wall. We extend previous theories in order to include finite
temperatures. Various applications are discussed. 1. We review the theory of
Axion Electrodynamics and particularly the energy-momentum conservation in a
linear dielectric and magnetic material. We treat this last aspect by extending
former results by Brevik and Chaichian (2022) and Patkos (2022). 2. Adopting
the model of the oscillating axion background we discuss the axion-induced
modifications to the Casimir force between two parallel plates by using a
Green's function approach. 3. We calculate the radiation pressure acting on an
axion domain wall at finite temperature T. Our results for an oscillating axion
field and a domain wall are also useful for condensed matter physics, where
""axionic topological insulators"" interact with the electromagnetic field with a
Chern-Simons interaction, like the one in Axion Electrodynamics, and there are
experimental systems analogous to time-dependent axion fields and domain walls
as the ones showed by Jiang, Q. D., \& Wilczek, F. (2019) and Fukushima et al.

Recent observations confirm planet-like radio emission such as aurorae from
large-scale magnetospheric current systems on very low mass stars and brown
dwarfs. These objects, collectively known as ultracool dwarfs, also exhibit
quiescent radio emission hypothesized to trace stellar coronal flare activity
or extrasolar radiation belt analogs. Here we present high resolution imaging
of the ultracool dwarf LSR J1835+3259 demonstrating that this radio emission is
spatially resolved and traces a long-lived, double-lobed, and axisymmetric
structure similar in morphology to the Jovian radiation belts. Up to 18
ultracool dwarf radii separate the two lobes. This structure is stably present
in three observations spanning >1 year. We infer a belt-like distribution of
plasma confined by the magnetic dipole of LSR J1835+3259, and we estimate ~15
MeV electron energies that are consistent with those measured in the Jovian
radiation belts. Though more precise constraints require higher frequency
observations, a unified picture where radio emissions in ultracool dwarfs

several orders of magnitude due to the use of a thicker liquid target -- when
compared to thin films or gas targets -- and from the reciprocity theorem. We
discuss the results of an experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, where the cross section of the photodisintegration

superheated fluid of C$_3$F$_8$ with bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays produced by
impinging a 4 - 5.5 MeV electron beam on a Cu radiator. From the
photodissociation yield the cross section was extracted by performing a
convolution with a Monte Carlo-generated $\gamma$-ray beam spectrum. The
measurement produced a cross section that was then time inverted using the
reciprocity theorem. The cross section for the
$^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F reaction was determined down to a value in

"GEAR-RT: Towards Exa-Scale Moment Based Radiative Transfer For
  Cosmological Simulations Using Task-Based Parallelism And Dynamic Sub-Cycling
  with SWIFT",,[{'name': 'Mladen Ivkovic'}],10.5075/epfl-thesis-9973,2023-02-24T16:24:19Z,"The development and implementation of GEAR-RT, a radiative transfer solver
using the M1 closure in the open source code SWIFT, is presented, and validated
using standard tests for radiative transfer. GEAR-RT is modeled after RAMSES-RT
(Rosdahl et al. 2013) with some key differences. Firstly, while RAMSES-RT uses
Finite Volume methods and an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy, GEAR-RT
employs particles as discretization elements and solves the equations using a
Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM). Secondly, GEAR-RT makes use of the
task-based parallelization strategy of SWIFT, which allows for optimized load
balancing, increased cache efficiency, asynchronous communications, and a
domain decomposition based on work rather than on data. GEAR-RT is able to
perform sub-cycles of radiative transfer steps w.r.t. a single hydrodynamics
step. Radiation requires much smaller time step sizes than hydrodynamics, and
sub-cycling permits calculations which are not strictly necessary to be
skipped. Indeed, in a test case with gravity, hydrodynamics, and radiative
transfer, the sub-cycling is able to reduce the runtime of a simulation by over
90%. Allowing only a part of the involved physics to be sub-cycled is a
contrived matter when task-based parallelism is involved, and is an entirely
novel feature in SWIFT.
  Since GEAR-RT uses a FVPM, a detailed introduction into Finite Volume methods
and Finite Volume Particle Methods is presented. In astrophysical literature,
two FVPM methods are written about: Hopkins (2015) have implemented one in
their GIZMO code, while the one mentioned in Ivanova et al. (2013) isn't used
to date. In this work, I test an implementation of the Ivanova et al. (2013)
version, and conclude that in its current form, it is not suitable for use with
particles which are co-moving with the fluid, which in turn is an essential
feature for cosmological simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12727v1,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"
