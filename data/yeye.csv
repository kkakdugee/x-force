  Disruption Events",,"['Chengchao Yuan', 'Walter Winter']",,2023-06-27T17:54:29Z,"The potential association between Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and high-energy astrophysical neutrinos implies the acceleration of cosmic rays. These accelerated particles will initiate electromagnetic (EM) cascades spanning from keV to GeV energies by the processes related to neutrino production. We model the EM cascade and neutrino emissions by numerically solving the time-dependent transport equations and discuss the implications for AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands. We show that the $\gamma$-ray constraints from \emph{Fermi} can constrain the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energy of injected protons, and that the corresponding expected neutrino event numbers in follow-up searches are limited to be less than about 0.1. Depending on the efficiency of $p\gamma$ interactions, the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray signals can be expected closer to the peak of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity, or to the time of the neutrino production.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15659,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'hep-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

However, very little is known about their formation. Episodic accretion may play a crucial role, but observations of these events have only been reported towards a handful of massive protostars. We aim to investigate the outburst event from the high-mass star-forming region S255IR where recently the protostar NIRS3 underwent an accretion outburst. We follow the evolution of this source both in photometry and morphology of its surroundings. Methods: We perform near-infrared adaptive optics observations on the S255IR central region using the Large Binocular Telescope in the K$_{\rm s}$ broad-band and the H$_2$ and Br$\gamma$ narrow-band filters with an angular resolution of $\sim0\farcs06$, close to the diffraction limit. We discover a new near-infrared knot north-east from NIRS3 that we interpret as a jet knot that was ejected during the last accretion outburst and observed in the radio regime as part of a follow-up after the outburst. We measure a mean tangential velocity for this knot of $450\pm50\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We analyse the continuum-subtracted images from H$_2$ which traces jet shocked emission, and Br$\gamma$ which traces scattered light from a combination of accretion activity and UV radiation from the central massive protostar. We observe a significant decrease in flux at the location of NIRS3, with K=13.48\,mag being the absolute minimum in the historic series. Our observations strongly suggest a scenario where the episodic accretion is followed by an episodic ejection response in the near-infrared, as it was seen in the earlier radio follow-up. The 30 years of $\sim2\,\mu{\rm m}$ photometry suggests that NIRS3 might have undergone another outburst in the late 1980s, being the first massive protostar with such evidence observed in the near-infrared.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15542,"[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.GA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

Classically, particles become causally excluded from regions of spacetime beyond a null surface which we identify as the `electromagnetic horizon'. In the quantum theory there is pair production at the horizon via the Schwinger effect, but only one particle from the pair escapes the field. Furthermore, unitarity appears to be violated when crossing the horizon, and there is no well-defined S-matrix. Despite this, we show how to use the perturbiner method to construct `amplitudes' which contain all the dynamical information required to construct observables related to pair creation, and to radiation from particles scattering on the background.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15475,"[{'term': 'hep-th', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'hep-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

These nonlinear ratchet currents are studied in structures of two designs with dual grating gate fabricated on top of encapsulated bilayer graphene and beneath it. The strength and sign of the photocurrent can be controllably varied by changing the bias voltages applied to individual dual grating subgates and the back gate. The current consists of contributions insensitive to the radiation's polarization state, defined by the orientation of the radiation electric field vector with respect to the dual grating gate metal stripes, and the circular ratchet sensitive to the radiation helicity. We show that intense terahertz radiation results in a nonlinear intensity dependence caused by electron gas heating. At room temperature the ratchet current saturates at high intensities of the order of hundreds to several hundreds of kWcm$^{-2}$. At $T = 4 {\rm K}$, the nonlinearity manifests itself at intensities that are one or two orders of magnitude lower, moreover, the photoresponse exhibits a complex dependence on the intensity, including a saturation and even a change of sign with increasing intensity. This complexity is attributed to the interplay of the Seebeck ratchet and the dynamic carrier density redistribution, which feature different intensity dependencies and a nonlinear behavior of the sample's conductivity induced by electron gas heating. Our study demonstrates that graphene-based asymmetric dual grating gate devices can be used as terahertz detectors at room temperature over a wide dynamic range, spanning many orders of magnitude of terahertz radiation power. Therefore, their integration together with current-driven read-out electronics is attractive for the operation with high-power pulsed sources.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15405,"[{'term': 'cond-mat.mes-hall', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

Here, we demonstrate that CLE can also be used to measure excitation's decay time. In addition, the decay time as a function of the excitation energy is accessed, as the energy for each electron-photon pair is probed. We used two well-known insulating materials to characterize this technique, nanodiamonds with \textit{NV$^0$} defect emission and h-BN with a \textit{4.1 eV} defect emission. Both also exhibit marked transition radiations, whose extremely short decay times can be used to characterize the instrumental response function. It is found to be typically 2 ns, in agreement with the expected limit of the EELS detector temporal resolution. The measured lifetimes of \textit{NV$^0$} centers in diamond nanoparticles (20 to 40 ns) and \textit{4.1 eV} defect in h-BN flakes ($<$ 2 ns) matches those reported for those materials previously.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15372,"[{'term': 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

The diodes were exposed to dose values of 0.1, 0.2, 1, and \SI{2}{\mega Gy}. Both macroscopic ($I$--$V$, $C$--$V$) and microscopic (Thermally Stimulated Current~(TSC)) measurements were conducted to characterize the radiation-induced changes. The investigated diodes were manufactured on high resistivity $p$-type Float Zone (FZ) silicon and were further classified into two types based on the isolation technique between the pad and guard ring: $p$-stop and $p$-spray. After irradiation, the macroscopic results of current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements were obtained and compared with existing literature data. Additionally, the microscopic measurements focused on the development of the concentration of different radiation-induced defects, including the boron interstitial and oxygen interstitial (B$_\text{i}$O$_\text{i}$) complex, the carbon interstitial and oxygen interstitial C$_\text{i}$O$_\text{i}$ defect, the H40K, and the so-called I$_\text{P}^*$. To investigate the thermal stability of induced defects in the bulk, isochronal annealing studies were performed in the temperature range of \SI{80}{\celsius} to \SI{300}{\celsius}. These annealing processes were carried out on diodes irradiated with doses of 1 and \SI{2}{\mega Gy} and the corresponding TSC spectra were analysed. Furthermore, in order to investigate the unexpected results observed in the $C$-$V$ measurements after irradiation with high dose values, the surface conductance between the pad and guard ring was measured as a function of both dose and annealing temperature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15336,"[{'term': 'physics.ins-det', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

To characterize the invisible, we isolate matter, energy and radiation from the space-time within a model that leads to approach the change of the space-time entropy generation not as the change of a state function based on heat, or based on the number of micro-states, or based on the measure of information, but rather based on curvature transformation of an homogeneous and isotropic expanding space-time that expands simultaneously via discrete expansion of its basic elements. This case study leads to model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang that has revealed the last scattering surface from where originates the cosmic microwave background radiation. The consideration of matter with this model allows to identify the origin of gravity, to describe the earliest conditions for the space transformation just after the Big Bang, and to determine the major role for the space of singularities for the first transformations of the space and for matter recombination after its dislocation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15335,"[{'term': 'physics.gen-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '28D20, 83C57', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

We also introduce a new method for systematically obtaining initial data for quintessence evolution by using dynamical systems properties; in particular, this method exploits that there exists a radiation dominated line of fixed points with an unstable quintessence attractor submanifold, which plays a role that is reminiscent of that of the inflationary attractor solution for inflation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15326,"[{'term': 'gr-qc', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

  Non-transmission Power",,"['Guanlin Wu', 'Yuan Fang', 'Jie Xu', 'Zhiyong Feng', 'Shuguang Cui']",,2023-06-27T08:45:28Z,"This paper investigates the energy efficiency of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, in which one multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits unified ISAC signals to a multi-antenna communication user (CU) and at the same time use the echo signals to estimate an extended target. We focus on one particular ISAC transmission block and take into account the practical on-off non-transmission power at the BS. Under this setup, we minimize the energy consumption at the BS while ensuring a minimum average data rate requirement for communication and a maximum Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) requirement for target estimation, by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the ``on'' duration for active transmission. We obtain the optimal solution to the rate-and-CRB-constrained energy minimization problem in a semi-closed form. Interestingly, the obtained optimal solution is shown to unify the spectrum-efficient and energy-efficient communications and sensing designs. In particular, for the special MIMO sensing case with rate constraint inactive, the optimal solution follows the isotropic transmission with shortest ``on'' duration, in which the BS radiates the required sensing energy by using sufficiently high power over the shortest duration. For the general ISAC case, the optimal transmit covariance solution is of full rank and follows the eigenmode transmission based on the communication channel, while the optimal ``on'' duration is determined based on both the rate and CRB constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed ISAC design achieves significantly reduced energy consumption as compared to the benchmark schemes based on isotropic transmission, always-on transmission, and sensing or communications only designs, especially when the rate and CRB constraints become stringent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15303,"[{'term': 'cs.IT', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'eess.SP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.IT', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

We engineer the local density of optical states in our resonator structures in two complementary experimental settings. In the first approach, we utilize an ultra-low quality factor planar vertical cavity structure, which develops multiple longitudinal modes that can be consecutively brought to resonance with the broad interlayer exciton spectrum of our heterostructure. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that the interlayer exciton lifetime can thus be periodically tuned with an amplitude of around 100 ps. The resulting oscillations of the exciton lifetime allows us to extract a free-space radiative exciton lifetime of 2.2 ns and an approximately 15 % quantum efficiency of the interlayer excitons. We subsequently engineered the local density of optical states by introducing a spatially confined and fully spectrally tunable Tamm-plasmon resonance. The dramatic redistribution of the local optical modes in this setting allows us to encounter a profound inhibition of spontaneous emission of the interlayer excitons by a factor of 3.3. Our results will further boost the cavity-mediated collective emission phenomena such as super-radiance. We expect that specifically engineering the inhibition of radiation from moire excitons is a powerful tool to steer their thermalization, and eventually their condensation into coherent condensate phases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15101,"[{'term': 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]"

We review here the effect of such an extra dark radiation component in the different cosmological observables, focusing mostly on $H_0$. While a larger value of $N_{\rm eff}$ automatically implies a larger value of the Hubble constant, and one would naively expect that such a simple scenario provides a decent solution, more elaborated models are required. Light sterile neutrinos or neutrino asymmetries are among the first-order corrections to the most economical (tree-level) massless dark radiation scenario. However, they are not fully satisfactory in solving the $H_0$ issue. We devote here special attention to second-order corrections: some interacting scenarios, such as those with new dark radiation degrees of freedom that exhibit a non-free streaming nature are highly satisfactory alternative cosmologies where to solve the Hubble constant tension.
