"Atmospheric chemistry of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde: Initiated by photo-excitation, OH-oxidation, and small TiO<inf>2</inf> clusters adsorption catalysis",Journal,Bai F.Y.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.008,2024,"The fate of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (2-NBA) is of interest in atmospheric chemistry as it is a semi-volatile organic compound with high photosensitivity. This study presents a quantum chemical study of the gas-phase reactions of 2-NBA photo-excitation and OH-oxidation in the absence and presence of small TiO2 clusters. To further understand the unknown photolysis mechanism, the photo-reaction pathways of ground singlet state and the lying excited triplet state of 2-NBA were investigated including the initial and subsequent reactions of proton transfer, direct CO, NO2, and HCO elimination routes in the presence of O2 and NO. Meanwhile, the OH-mediated degradation of 2-NBA proceeded via five H-extraction and six OH-addition channels by indirect mechanism, which follows a succession of reaction steps initiated by the formation of weakly stable intermediate complexes. The H-extraction from the –CHO group was the dominant pathway with a negative activation energy of -1.22 kcal/mol. The calculated rate coefficients at 200–600 K were close to the experimental data in literature within 308–352 K, and the kinetic negative temperature independence was found in both experimental literature and computational results. Interestingly, 2-NBA was favored to be captured onto small TiO2 clusters via six adsorption configurations formed via various combination of three types of bonds of Ti···O, Ti···C, and O···H between the molecularly adsorbed 2-NBA and TiO2 clusters. Comparison indicted that the chemisorptions of aldehyde oxygen have largest energies. The results suggested adsorption conformations have a respectable impact on the catalysis barrier. This study is significant for understanding the atmospheric chemistry of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002097,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Shenyang Normal University'}"
"Experimental and theoretical insight into carbamazepine degradation by chlorine‐based advanced oxidation processes: Efficiency, energy consumption, mechanism and DBPs formation",Journal,Liu C.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.012,2024,"Chlorine has been widely used in different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for micropollutants removal. In this study, different chlorine-based AOPs, namely medium pressure (MP) UV/chlorine, low pressure (LP) UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, were compared for carbamazepine (CBZ) removal efficiency, energy consumption, and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. All three processes could achieve nearly 100% CBZ removal, while the reaction time needed by in-situ chlorination was double the time required by UV/chlorine processes. The energy consumed per magnitude of CBZ removed (EE/O) of MP UV/chlorine was 13 times higher than that of LP UV/chlorine, and relative to that of in-situ chlorination process. Accordingly, MP and LP UV/chlorine processes generated one to two orders of magnitude more hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCS) than in-situ chlorination. Besides, RCS were the dominant reactive species, contributing to 78.3%, 75.6%, and 71.6% of CBZ removal in MP, LP UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, respectively. According to the Gibbs free energy barriers between CBZ and RCS/•OH calculated based on density functional theory (DFT), RCS had more reaction routes with CBZ and showed lower energy barrier in the main CBZ degradation pathways like epoxidation and formation of iminostilbene. When applied to secondary wastewater effluent, UV/chlorine and in-situ chlorination produced overall DBPs ranging from 104.77 to 135.41 µg/L. However, the production of chlorate during UV/chlorine processes was 15 times higher than that during in-situ chlorination.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002115,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Coal Processing and Efficient Clean Utilization'}"
Ferrihydrite transformation impacted by coprecipitation of lignin: Inhibition or facilitation?,Journal,Liu L.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.016,2024,"Lignin is a common soil organic matter that is present in soils, but its effect on the transformation of ferrihydrite (Fh) remains unclear. Organic matter is generally assumed to inhibit Fh transformation. However, lignin can reduce Fh to Fe(II), in which Fe(II)-catalyzed Fh transformation occurs. Herein, the effects of lignin on Fh transformation were investigated at 75°C as a function of the lignin/Fh mass ratio (0-0.2), pH (4-8) and aging time (0-96 hr). The results of Fh-lignin samples (mass ratios = 0.1) aged at different pH values showed that for Fh-lignin the time of Fh transformation into secondary crystalline minerals was significantly shortened at pH 6 when compared with pure Fh, and the Fe(II)-accelerated transformation of Fh was strongly dependent on pH. Under pH 6, at low lignin/Fh mass ratios (0.05-0.1), the time of secondary mineral formation decreased with increasing lignin content. For high lignosulfonate-content material (lignin:Fh = 0.2), Fh did not transform into secondary minerals, indicating that lignin content plays a major role in Fh transformation. In addition, lignin affected the pathway of Fh transformation by inhibiting goethite formation and facilitating hematite formation. The effect of coprecipitation of lignin on Fh transformation should be useful in understanding the complex iron and carbon cycles in a soil environment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002176,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Central South University'}"

In this study, single-atom Ag was successfully anchored on ultrathin carbon nitride (UTCN) via thermal polymerization, the catalyst obtained is called AgUTCN. The Ag hardly changed the carbon nitride's layered and porous physical structure. AgUTCN exhibited efficient visible-light photocatalytic performances in the degradation of various recalcitrant pollutants, eliminations of 85% were achieved by visible-light irradiation for 1 hr. Doping with Ag improved the photocatalytic performance of UTCN by narrowing the forbidden band gap from 2.49 to 2.36 eV and suppressing electron–hole pair recombination. In addition, Ag doping facilitated O2 adsorption on UTCN by decreasing the adsorption energy from −0.2 to −2.22 eV and favored the formation of O2·−.

The narrow band gap of the semiconductor material Fe3O4 greatly reduces the recombination of electron-hole pairs, enhancing non-radiative relaxation light absorption. The abundant π orbitals in rGO promote electron excitation and thermal vibration between the lattices. Control of the surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity promotes salt resistance while simultaneously achieving the purification of various complex polluted waters. The optimized GFM-3 sponge exhibitedan enhanced photothermal conversion rate of 97.3% and a water evaporation rate of 2.04 kg/(m2·hr), showing promising synergistic water purification properties.

A combined evaluation of the characteristics and antibiotic resistance induction potential of antibiotic wastewater during the treatment process,Journal,Miao S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.002,2024,"Antibiotic wastewater contains a variety of pollutant stressors that can induce and promote antibiotic resistance (AR) when released into the environment. Although these substances are mostly in concentrations lower than those known to induce AR individually, it is possible that antibiotic wastewater discharge might still promote the AR transmission risk via additive or synergistic effects. However, the comprehensive effect of antibiotic wastewater on AR development has rarely been evaluated, and its treatment efficiency remains unknown. Here, samples were collected from different stages of a cephalosporin production wastewater treatment plant, and the potential AR induction effect of their chemical mixtures was explored through the exposure of the antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 strain. Incubation with raw cephalosporin production wastewater significantly promoted mutation rates (3.6 × 103–9.3 × 103-fold) and minimum inhibition concentrations (6.0–6.7-fold) of E. coli against ampicillin and chloramphenicol. This may be attributed to the inhibition effect and oxidative stress of cephalosporin wastewater on E. coli. The AR induction effect of cephalosporin wastewater decreased after the coagulation sedimentation treatment and was completely removed after the full treatment process. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the reduction in the AR induction effect had a strong positive correlation with the removal of organics and biological toxicity. This indicates that the antibiotic wastewater treatment had a collaborative processing effect of conventional pollutants, toxicity, and the AR induction effect. This study illustrates the potential AR transmission risk of antibiotic wastewater and highlights the need for its adequate treatment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223001572,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Tsinghua University'}"
Development and evaluation of an online monitoring single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection,Journal,Yao W.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.010,2024,"We developed a single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection (SOPC) for the real-time measurement of the optical size and depolarization ratio (defined as the ratio of the vertical component to the parallel component of backward scattering) of atmospheric particles, the polarization ratio (DR) value can reflect the irregularity of the particles. The SOPC can detect aerosol particles with size larger than 500 nm and the maximum particle count rate reaches ∼1.8 × 105 particles per liter. The SOPC uses a modulated polarization laser to measure the optical size of particles according to forward scattering signal and the DR value of the particles by backward S and P signal components. The sampling rate of the SOPC was 106 #/(sec·channel), and all the raw data were processed online. The calibration curve was obtained by polystyrene latex spheres with sizes of 0.5-10 µm, and the average relative deviation of measurement was 3.96% for sub 3 µm particles. T-matrix method calculations showed that the DR value of backscatter light at 120° could describe the variations in the aspect ratio of particles in the above size range.

Elaborations of the influencing factors on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols in a heavily polluted urban area of China,Journal,Wang S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.022,2024,"In this study, online water-soluble inorganic ions were detected to deduce the formation mechanism of secondary inorganic aerosol in Xianyang, China during wintertime. The dominant inorganic ions of sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), and ammonium (NH4+) (the sum of those is abbreviated as SNA) accounted for 17%, 21%, and 12% of PM2.5 mass, respectively. While the air quality deteriorated from excellent to poor grades, the precursor gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) of SO42- increased and then decreased with a fluctuation, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3), precursors of NO3− and NH4+, and SNA show increasing trends. Meteorological factors including boundary layer height (BLH), temperature, and wind speed also show decline trends, except relative humidity (RH). Meanwhile, the secondary conversion ratio shows a remarkable increasing trend, indicating that there was a strong secondary transformation. From the perspective of chemical mechanisms, RH is positively correlated with sulfur oxidation ratios (SOR), nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR), and ammonia conversion ratios, representing that the increase of humidity could promote the generation of SNA. Notably, SOR and NOR were also positively related to the ammonia. On the one hand, the low wind speed and BLH led to the accumulation of pollutants. On the other hand, the increases of RH and ammonia promoted more formations of SNA and PM2.5.

Facile low-temperature supercritical carbonization method to prepare high-loading nickel single atom catalysts for efficient photodegradation of tetracycline,Journal,Qiao H.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.020,2024,"Environmental photocatalysis is a promising technology for treating antibiotics in wastewater. In this study, a supercritical carbonization method was developed to synthesize a single-atom photocatalyst with a high loading of Ni (above 5 wt.%) anchored on a carbon-nitrogen-silicate substrate for the efficient photodegradation of a ubiquitous environmental contaminant of tetracycline (TC). The photocatalyst was prepared from an easily obtained metal-biopolymer-inorganic supramolecular hydrogel, followed by supercritical drying and carbonization treatment. The low-temperature (300°C) supercritical ethanol treatment prevents the excessive structural degradation of hydrogel and greatly reduces the metal clustering and aggregation, which contributed to the high Ni loading. Atomic characterizations confirmed that Ni was present at isolated sites and stabilized by Ni-N and Ni-O bonds in a Ni-(N/O)6C/SiC configuration. A 5% Ni-C-Si catalyst, which performed the best among the studied catalysts, exhibited a wide visible light response with a narrow bandgap of 1.45 eV that could efficiently and repeatedly catalyze the oxidation of TC with a conversion rate of almost 100% within 40 min. The reactive species trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests demonstrated that the h+, and ·O2− were mainly responsible for TC degradation. The TC degradation mechanism and possible reaction pathways were provided also.

But the acute biotoxicity was significantly reduced in BE-A/O process. And the genotoxicity and oxidative damage to Tetrahymena thermophila were significantly decreased after advanced treatment. The polar organics in CCW were identified as the main biotoxicity contributors. Phenols were positively correlated with acute biotoxicity, while the nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were positively correlated with genotoxicity.

Fe/S oxidation-coupled arsenic speciation transformation mediated by AMD enrichment culture under different pH conditions,Journal,Zhou Y.h.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.008,2024,"Arsenic (As) speciation transformation in acid mine drainage (AMD) is comprehensively affected by biological and abiotic factors, such as microbially mediated Fe/S redox reactions and changes in environmental conditions (pH and oxidation-reduction potential). However, their combined impacts on arsenic speciation transformation remain poorly studied. Therefore, we explored arsenic transformation and immobilization during pyrite dissolution mediated by AMD enrichment culture under different acidic pH conditions. The results for incubation and mineralogical transformation of solid residues show that in the presence of AMD enrichment culture, pH 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are more conducive to the formation of jarosites and ferric arsenate, which could immobilize high quantities of dissolved arsenic by adsorption and coprecipitation.

This is mainly associated with releasing internal vapor pressure in the autoclave where the hydrothermal treatment of the urea/melamine mixture is processed. Supported by microscopic observation, porosity measurement and spectroscopic characterization, it is found that releasing the pressure at halfway of hydrothermal process is vital for forming exfoliated rod-like precursors and the de-aggregation of these rods presents substantial benefits on the production of mesopores on g-C3N4 micro-tubes during the calcination of precursors.

Pearson correlation analysis showed that pH was the main control factor affecting the non-residue fractions of HMs. Therefore, acid production from high sulfur CG reduced soil pH by 2-3, which indirectly promoted the activity of HMs. Finally, the conceptual model of HMs contamination at the CG site was proposed, which can be useful for the development of ecological remediation strategies.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006374,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'University of Science and Technology Beijing'}"
The biochemical behavior and mechanism of uranium(Ⅵ) bioreduction induced by natural Bacillus thuringiensis,Journal,Chen S.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.001,2024,"For a broader understanding of uranium migration affected by microorganisms in natural anaerobic environment, the bioreduction of uranium(Ⅵ) (U(Ⅵ)) was revealed in Bacillus thuringiensis, a dominant bacterium strain with potential of uranium-tolerant isolated from uranium contaminated soil. The reduction behavior was systematically investigated by the quantitative analysis of U(Ⅳ) in bacteria, and mechanism was inferred from the pathway of electron transmission. Under anaerobic conditions, appropriate biomass and sodium lactate as electron donor, reduction behavior of U(Ⅵ) induced by B. thuringiensis was restricted by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, which was directly affected by the initial pH, temperature and initial U(Ⅵ) concentration of bioreduction system. Bioreduction of U(Ⅵ) was driven by the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from enzymatic reaction of sodium lactate with various dehydrogenase. The transmission of the electrons from bacteria to U(Ⅵ) was mainly supported by the intracellular NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquinone system, this process could maintain the biological activity of cells.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006167,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Sichuan University'}"

However, whether this technology efficiently removes the pollutants to prevent secondary pollution and health risk is still unclear. Here, the photodegradation processes of three xylenes were compared under designed reaction atmospheres and light sources. Xe lamp showed poor photodegradation ability toward xylenes, no matter in N2 or N2+O2 system, while much higher photodegradation performance of xylenes were obtained under ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, especially in N2+O2+VUV system, where 97.9% of m-xylene, 99.0% of o-xylene or 87.5% of p-xylene with the initial concentration of 860 mg/m3 was removed within 240 min. The xylenes underwent three processes of photo-isomerization, photodecomposition and photo-oxidation to produce intermediates of aromatics, alkanes and carbonyls. Among them, the photo-isomerization products showed the highest concentration percentage (e.g., ≥50% in o-xylene system), confirming that photo-isomerization reaction was the dominated photodegradation process of xylenes. Moreover, these isomerized products not only contributed about 97% and 91% to the formation potential of O3 (OFP) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAFP), but also displayed obvious non-carcinogenic risk, although one of photodecomposition product—benzene showed the highest occupational exposure risk. Therefore, the secondary pollution and health risks of photodegradation products of xylenes were non-ignorable, although the OFP, SOAFP and health risks of the generated products reduced at least 4.5 times in comparison with that of the degraded xylenes. The findings are helpful for the appropriate application of this technology in the purification of industrial organic waste gas.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223000025,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Guangdong University of Technology'}"

Nearly 89% articles had a mixture of Ag- and Zn-containing NPs and the teethers had relatively high Ag and Zn contents (up to 501 and 254 µg/g, respectively). Steam disinfection caused rubber decomposition into micro(nano)plastics (0.54−15.7 µm) and NP release from the interior of bulk rubber and micro-sized plastics, thus enhancing the IVBA of Ag and Zn by up to 5.5 times.

However, researches on the damage of tebuconazole exposure to energy metabolism and the related molecular mechanisms are limited. In the present study, male C57BL/6 mice were treated with tebuconazole at different low concentrations for 4 weeks. The results indicated that tebuconazole could accumulate in the heart and further induce the decrease of ATP content in the mouse heart. Importantly, tebuconazole induced an obvious shift in substrate utilization of fatty acid and glucose by disrupting their corresponding transporters (GLUT1, GLUT4, CD36, FABP3 and FATP1) expression, and significantly repressed the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (Gabpa and Tfam) and oxidative phosphorylation (CS, Ndufa4, Sdhb, Cox5a and Atp5b) related genes in a dose-dependent manner.

The sensitivity of meteorological changes to identical aerosol loads varied in the order July > January > October and April. Then, the cooling and stabilizing effects of aerosols further led to increases in PM2.5, by 23.0, 3.4, 4.6, and 7.3 µg/m3 respectively in the four months. The sensitivity of the effect of aerosols on PM2.5 was greatest in January rather than in July, contrary to the effect on meteorology. Moreover, a negative linear relation was observed between daily BLH reductions and aerosol loads in fall and winter, and between PM2.5 increases and aerosol loads in all seasons. With the PM2.5 pollution improvements in this region, the aerosol radiative forcing was effectively reduced. This should result in daily BLH increases of 10–24 m in fall and winter, and the estimates in Beijing agreed well with the corresponding results based on AMDAR data.

In the Bransfield Strait (BS), C. wilsoni has received considerable attention as it preys predominantly on krill. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the keystone species in the Southern Ocean, has a versatile feeding strategy, particularly in a highly dynamic environment. The central basin of the BS is a highly dynamic environment, providing an ideal place to explore the application of biochemical tracers in a specialist predator to reveal the diet of its prey. In this study, fatty acid and stable isotopic data demonstrated that the trophic niche of C. wilsoni expanded from late austral summer to early fall, which was primarily reflected in variability in the food availability of krill, i.e., herbivorous features were weakened, benthic-feeding features were strengthened, and omnivorous features showed no significant difference. A highly dynamic hydrography, coupled with an unusual diatom bloom in the BS during 2016, may have resulted in krill's prolonged filtering on diatoms in the water column, which was further reflected in the difference in biochemical tracers of C. wilsoni from late austral summer to early fall.

CFD-DEM simulation of fluorination reaction in fluidized beds with local grid and time refinement method,Journal,Qiu M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.016,2024,"The gas-solid reaction process with wide particle size distribution is extensively used in the chemical engineering field, especially the particle reacts with the gas gradually, such as fluorination reactions in fluidized beds. When the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is used for the coupling simulation of multiphase and polydisperse particle reaction system, the grid size directly affects the accuracy of flow field information and simulation of chemical reaction. Furthermore, particle calculation time step will directly affect the efficiency of coupling calculation. In this work, a local grid and time step refinement method is proposed to simulate multiphase and polydisperse particle fluidization reaction system. In this method, the refined DEM grids are automatically generated in the computational domain around the fine particles, and the detailed fluid phase information is obtained with the interpolation algorithm. In the two-phase coupling process, particles are divided into different groups based on physical properties, each group has its own independent time step. The multistage conical-cylindrical spouted bed is proposed for the fluorination reaction process; the operating gas velocity range of the polydisperse particle system is extended by the new design while the particle size distribution changes with the gas-solid reaction process. It is demonstrated that the local grid and time step refinement method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the traditional CFD-DEM method in the reaction process simulation, which describes a polydisperse particle system with wide particle size distribution.

A numerical and experimental comparison of heat transfer in a quasi two-dimensional packed bed,Journal,Tyslik M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.014,2024,"Heat transfer plays a major role in many industrial processes taking place in packed beds. An accurate and reliable simulation of the heat exchange between particles is therefore crucial for a reliable operation and to optimize the processes in the bed. The discrete ordinates method (DOM) provides an established numerical technique to model radiative heat transfer in granular media that offers the possibility to consider the directional dependence of the radiation propagation. In this work, DOM is compared with Monte Carlo ray tracing, which provides an alternative method for heat transfer simulations. Geometrically simple configurations are used to investigate the influence of the angular discretization on the accuracy of the results and the computation time in both methods. The obtained insights are then transferred to a more complex configuration of a quasi two-dimensional test rig consisting of metal rods for which also experimental results are available. Our results show that both DOM and Monte Carlo ray tracing allow for an accurate simulation of heat transfer in packed beds. Monte Carlo ray tracing requires thereby computation times that are surprisingly competitive (although still somewhat slower) compared to DOM and allows for an easier computation of highly accurate reference solutions. In our preliminary comparison to the experimental test rig, Monte Carlo ray tracing also provides the advantage that it can more easily model highly specular materials such as stainless steel.

Acetylacetone effectively controlled the secondary metabolites of Microcystis aeruginosa under simulated sunlight irradiation,Journal,Wang X.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.004,2024,"Inactivation of cyanobacterial cells and simultaneous control of secondary metabolites is of significant necessity for the treatment of cyanobacteria-laden water. Acetylacetone (AcAc) has been reported a specific algicide to inactivate Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and an effective light activator to degrade pollutants. This study systematically investigated the photodegradation ability of AcAc under xenon (Xe) irradiation on the secondary metabolites of M. aeruginosa, mainly algal organic matter (AOM), especially toxic microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Results showed that AcAc outperformed H2O2 in destructing the protein-like substances, humic acid-like matters, aromatic proteins and fulvic-like substances of AOM. For MC-LR (250 µg/L), 0.05 mmol/L AcAc attained the same degradation efficiency (87.0%) as 0.1 mmol/L H2O2. The degradation mechanism of Xe/AcAc might involve photo-induced energy/electron transfer and formation of carbon center radicals. Alkaline conditions (pH > 9.0) were detrimental to the photoactivity of AcAc, corresponding to the observed degradation rate constant (k1 value) of MC-LR drastically decreasing to 0.0013 min−1 as solution pH exceeded 9.0. The PO43− and HCO3− ions had obvious inhibition effects, whereas NO3− slightly improved k1 value from 0.0277 min−1 to 0.0321 min−1. The presence of AOM did not significantly inhibit MC-LR degradation in Xe/AcAc system. In addition, the biological toxicity of MC-LR was greatly reduced after photoreaction.

The specific surface area of FBC increased from 145.20 to 303.50 m2/g, and oxygen-containing functional groups increased from 1.26 to 1.48 mol/g after freeze-thaw cycles, greatly enhancing the adsorption of DEHP by biochar in the soil.

Compared with FBC, FTC-BC performed better in protecting the normal growth of pakchoi and improving soil properties. In addition, the application of biochar increased the diversity and abundance of bacteria in the DEHP-contaminated soil and changed the composition of the soil bacterial community. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) showed that adding biochar as a soil remediation agent significantly positively impacted soil nutrients and indirectly reduced the DEHP levels in soil and plants by increasing soil microbial diversity.

Significant increases in gaseous pollutants (CO, CH4, N2O, VOCs, etc.) and particles (including black carbon) were found within the wildfire plumes, leading to a reduced air quality. Emission factors, defined as EF (X) = ∆X/∆CO (where, X represents the target species), of various trace gases and black carbon within the young wildfire plumes were determined accordingly and compared with previous studies.

Moreover, we estimated the total carbon and climate-related species (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC) emissions and compared them with fire emission inventories. Current biomass burning emission inventories have uncertainties in estimating small fire burned areas and emissions.

To further understand the unknown photolysis mechanism, the photo-reaction pathways of ground singlet state and the lying excited triplet state of 2-NBA were investigated including the initial and subsequent reactions of proton transfer, direct CO, NO2, and HCO elimination routes in the presence of O2 and NO. Meanwhile, the OH-mediated degradation of 2-NBA proceeded via five H-extraction and six OH-addition channels by indirect mechanism, which follows a succession of reaction steps initiated by the formation of weakly stable intermediate complexes. The H-extraction from the –CHO group was the dominant pathway with a negative activation energy of -1.22 kcal/mol. The calculated rate coefficients at 200–600 K were close to the experimental data in literature within 308–352 K, and the kinetic negative temperature independence was found in both experimental literature and computational results. Interestingly, 2-NBA was favored to be captured onto small TiO2 clusters via six adsorption configurations formed via various combination of three types of bonds of Ti···O, Ti···C, and O···H between the molecularly adsorbed 2-NBA and TiO2 clusters. Comparison indicted that the chemisorptions of aldehyde oxygen have largest energies. The results suggested adsorption conformations have a respectable impact on the catalysis barrier.

"Experimental and theoretical insight into carbamazepine degradation by chlorine‐based advanced oxidation processes: Efficiency, energy consumption, mechanism and DBPs formation",Journal,Liu C.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.012,2024,"Chlorine has been widely used in different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for micropollutants removal. In this study, different chlorine-based AOPs, namely medium pressure (MP) UV/chlorine, low pressure (LP) UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, were compared for carbamazepine (CBZ) removal efficiency, energy consumption, and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. All three processes could achieve nearly 100% CBZ removal, while the reaction time needed by in-situ chlorination was double the time required by UV/chlorine processes. The energy consumed per magnitude of CBZ removed (EE/O) of MP UV/chlorine was 13 times higher than that of LP UV/chlorine, and relative to that of in-situ chlorination process. Accordingly, MP and LP UV/chlorine processes generated one to two orders of magnitude more hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCS) than in-situ chlorination. Besides, RCS were the dominant reactive species, contributing to 78.3%, 75.6%, and 71.6% of CBZ removal in MP, LP UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, respectively. According to the Gibbs free energy barriers between CBZ and RCS/•OH calculated based on density functional theory (DFT), RCS had more reaction routes with CBZ and showed lower energy barrier in the main CBZ degradation pathways like epoxidation and formation of iminostilbene. When applied to secondary wastewater effluent, UV/chlorine and in-situ chlorination produced overall DBPs ranging from 104.77 to 135.41 µg/L. However, the production of chlorate during UV/chlorine processes was 15 times higher than that during in-situ chlorination.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002115,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Coal Processing and Efficient Clean Utilization'}"
Ferrihydrite transformation impacted by coprecipitation of lignin: Inhibition or facilitation?,Journal,Liu L.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.016,2024,"Lignin is a common soil organic matter that is present in soils, but its effect on the transformation of ferrihydrite (Fh) remains unclear. Organic matter is generally assumed to inhibit Fh transformation. However, lignin can reduce Fh to Fe(II), in which Fe(II)-catalyzed Fh transformation occurs. Herein, the effects of lignin on Fh transformation were investigated at 75°C as a function of the lignin/Fh mass ratio (0-0.2), pH (4-8) and aging time (0-96 hr). The results of Fh-lignin samples (mass ratios = 0.1) aged at different pH values showed that for Fh-lignin the time of Fh transformation into secondary crystalline minerals was significantly shortened at pH 6 when compared with pure Fh, and the Fe(II)-accelerated transformation of Fh was strongly dependent on pH. Under pH 6, at low lignin/Fh mass ratios (0.05-0.1), the time of secondary mineral formation decreased with increasing lignin content. For high lignosulfonate-content material (lignin:Fh = 0.2), Fh did not transform into secondary minerals, indicating that lignin content plays a major role in Fh transformation. In addition, lignin affected the pathway of Fh transformation by inhibiting goethite formation and facilitating hematite formation. The effect of coprecipitation of lignin on Fh transformation should be useful in understanding the complex iron and carbon cycles in a soil environment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002176,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Central South University'}"

The Ag hardly changed the carbon nitride's layered and porous physical structure. AgUTCN exhibited efficient visible-light photocatalytic performances in the degradation of various recalcitrant pollutants, eliminations of 85% were achieved by visible-light irradiation for 1 hr. Doping with Ag improved the photocatalytic performance of UTCN by narrowing the forbidden band gap from 2.49 to 2.36 eV and suppressing electron–hole pair recombination. In addition, Ag doping facilitated O2 adsorption on UTCN by decreasing the adsorption energy from −0.2 to −2.22 eV and favored the formation of O2·−.

A combined evaluation of the characteristics and antibiotic resistance induction potential of antibiotic wastewater during the treatment process,Journal,Miao S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.002,2024,"Antibiotic wastewater contains a variety of pollutant stressors that can induce and promote antibiotic resistance (AR) when released into the environment. Although these substances are mostly in concentrations lower than those known to induce AR individually, it is possible that antibiotic wastewater discharge might still promote the AR transmission risk via additive or synergistic effects. However, the comprehensive effect of antibiotic wastewater on AR development has rarely been evaluated, and its treatment efficiency remains unknown. Here, samples were collected from different stages of a cephalosporin production wastewater treatment plant, and the potential AR induction effect of their chemical mixtures was explored through the exposure of the antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 strain. Incubation with raw cephalosporin production wastewater significantly promoted mutation rates (3.6 × 103–9.3 × 103-fold) and minimum inhibition concentrations (6.0–6.7-fold) of E. coli against ampicillin and chloramphenicol. This may be attributed to the inhibition effect and oxidative stress of cephalosporin wastewater on E. coli. The AR induction effect of cephalosporin wastewater decreased after the coagulation sedimentation treatment and was completely removed after the full treatment process. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the reduction in the AR induction effect had a strong positive correlation with the removal of organics and biological toxicity. This indicates that the antibiotic wastewater treatment had a collaborative processing effect of conventional pollutants, toxicity, and the AR induction effect.

Development and evaluation of an online monitoring single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection,Journal,Yao W.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.010,2024,"We developed a single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection (SOPC) for the real-time measurement of the optical size and depolarization ratio (defined as the ratio of the vertical component to the parallel component of backward scattering) of atmospheric particles, the polarization ratio (DR) value can reflect the irregularity of the particles. The SOPC can detect aerosol particles with size larger than 500 nm and the maximum particle count rate reaches ∼1.8 × 105 particles per liter. The SOPC uses a modulated polarization laser to measure the optical size of particles according to forward scattering signal and the DR value of the particles by backward S and P signal components.

Elaborations of the influencing factors on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols in a heavily polluted urban area of China,Journal,Wang S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.022,2024,"In this study, online water-soluble inorganic ions were detected to deduce the formation mechanism of secondary inorganic aerosol in Xianyang, China during wintertime. The dominant inorganic ions of sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), and ammonium (NH4+) (the sum of those is abbreviated as SNA) accounted for 17%, 21%, and 12% of PM2.5 mass, respectively. While the air quality deteriorated from excellent to poor grades, the precursor gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) of SO42- increased and then decreased with a fluctuation, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3), precursors of NO3− and NH4+, and SNA show increasing trends. Meteorological factors including boundary layer height (BLH), temperature, and wind speed also show decline trends, except relative humidity (RH). Meanwhile, the secondary conversion ratio shows a remarkable increasing trend, indicating that there was a strong secondary transformation. From the perspective of chemical mechanisms, RH is positively correlated with sulfur oxidation ratios (SOR), nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR), and ammonia conversion ratios, representing that the increase of humidity could promote the generation of SNA. Notably, SOR and NOR were also positively related to the ammonia. On the one hand, the low wind speed and BLH led to the accumulation of pollutants. On the other hand, the increases of RH and ammonia promoted more formations of SNA and PM2.5.

Facile low-temperature supercritical carbonization method to prepare high-loading nickel single atom catalysts for efficient photodegradation of tetracycline,Journal,Qiao H.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.020,2024,"Environmental photocatalysis is a promising technology for treating antibiotics in wastewater. In this study, a supercritical carbonization method was developed to synthesize a single-atom photocatalyst with a high loading of Ni (above 5 wt.%) anchored on a carbon-nitrogen-silicate substrate for the efficient photodegradation of a ubiquitous environmental contaminant of tetracycline (TC). The photocatalyst was prepared from an easily obtained metal-biopolymer-inorganic supramolecular hydrogel, followed by supercritical drying and carbonization treatment. The low-temperature (300°C) supercritical ethanol treatment prevents the excessive structural degradation of hydrogel and greatly reduces the metal clustering and aggregation, which contributed to the high Ni loading. Atomic characterizations confirmed that Ni was present at isolated sites and stabilized by Ni-N and Ni-O bonds in a Ni-(N/O)6C/SiC configuration. A 5% Ni-C-Si catalyst, which performed the best among the studied catalysts, exhibited a wide visible light response with a narrow bandgap of 1.45 eV that could efficiently and repeatedly catalyze the oxidation of TC with a conversion rate of almost 100% within 40 min. The reactive species trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests demonstrated that the h+, and ·O2− were mainly responsible for TC degradation.

Pearson correlation analysis showed that pH was the main control factor affecting the non-residue fractions of HMs. Therefore, acid production from high sulfur CG reduced soil pH by 2-3, which indirectly promoted the activity of HMs. Finally, the conceptual model of HMs contamination at the CG site was proposed, which can be useful for the development of ecological remediation strategies.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006374,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'University of Science and Technology Beijing'}"
The biochemical behavior and mechanism of uranium(Ⅵ) bioreduction induced by natural Bacillus thuringiensis,Journal,Chen S.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.001,2024,"For a broader understanding of uranium migration affected by microorganisms in natural anaerobic environment, the bioreduction of uranium(Ⅵ) (U(Ⅵ)) was revealed in Bacillus thuringiensis, a dominant bacterium strain with potential of uranium-tolerant isolated from uranium contaminated soil. The reduction behavior was systematically investigated by the quantitative analysis of U(Ⅳ) in bacteria, and mechanism was inferred from the pathway of electron transmission. Under anaerobic conditions, appropriate biomass and sodium lactate as electron donor, reduction behavior of U(Ⅵ) induced by B. thuringiensis was restricted by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, which was directly affected by the initial pH, temperature and initial U(Ⅵ) concentration of bioreduction system. Bioreduction of U(Ⅵ) was driven by the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from enzymatic reaction of sodium lactate with various dehydrogenase. The transmission of the electrons from bacteria to U(Ⅵ) was mainly supported by the intracellular NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquinone system, this process could maintain the biological activity of cells.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006167,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Sichuan University'}"

However, whether this technology efficiently removes the pollutants to prevent secondary pollution and health risk is still unclear. Here, the photodegradation processes of three xylenes were compared under designed reaction atmospheres and light sources. Xe lamp showed poor photodegradation ability toward xylenes, no matter in N2 or N2+O2 system, while much higher photodegradation performance of xylenes were obtained under ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, especially in N2+O2+VUV system, where 97.9% of m-xylene, 99.0% of o-xylene or 87.5% of p-xylene with the initial concentration of 860 mg/m3 was removed within 240 min. The xylenes underwent three processes of photo-isomerization, photodecomposition and photo-oxidation to produce intermediates of aromatics, alkanes and carbonyls. Among them, the photo-isomerization products showed the highest concentration percentage (e.g., ≥50% in o-xylene system), confirming that photo-isomerization reaction was the dominated photodegradation process of xylenes. Moreover, these isomerized products not only contributed about 97% and 91% to the formation potential of O3 (OFP) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAFP), but also displayed obvious non-carcinogenic risk, although one of photodecomposition product—benzene showed the highest occupational exposure risk. Therefore, the secondary pollution and health risks of photodegradation products of xylenes were non-ignorable, although the OFP, SOAFP and health risks of the generated products reduced at least 4.5 times in comparison with that of the degraded xylenes. The findings are helpful for the appropriate application of this technology in the purification of industrial organic waste gas.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223000025,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Guangdong University of Technology'}"

Nearly 89% articles had a mixture of Ag- and Zn-containing NPs and the teethers had relatively high Ag and Zn contents (up to 501 and 254 µg/g, respectively). Steam disinfection caused rubber decomposition into micro(nano)plastics (0.54−15.7 µm) and NP release from the interior of bulk rubber and micro-sized plastics, thus enhancing the IVBA of Ag and Zn by up to 5.5 times.

However, researches on the damage of tebuconazole exposure to energy metabolism and the related molecular mechanisms are limited. In the present study, male C57BL/6 mice were treated with tebuconazole at different low concentrations for 4 weeks. The results indicated that tebuconazole could accumulate in the heart and further induce the decrease of ATP content in the mouse heart. Importantly, tebuconazole induced an obvious shift in substrate utilization of fatty acid and glucose by disrupting their corresponding transporters (GLUT1, GLUT4, CD36, FABP3 and FATP1) expression, and significantly repressed the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (Gabpa and Tfam) and oxidative phosphorylation (CS, Ndufa4, Sdhb, Cox5a and Atp5b) related genes in a dose-dependent manner.

The sensitivity of meteorological changes to identical aerosol loads varied in the order July > January > October and April. Then, the cooling and stabilizing effects of aerosols further led to increases in PM2.5, by 23.0, 3.4, 4.6, and 7.3 µg/m3 respectively in the four months. The sensitivity of the effect of aerosols on PM2.5 was greatest in January rather than in July, contrary to the effect on meteorology. Moreover, a negative linear relation was observed between daily BLH reductions and aerosol loads in fall and winter, and between PM2.5 increases and aerosol loads in all seasons. With the PM2.5 pollution improvements in this region, the aerosol radiative forcing was effectively reduced. This should result in daily BLH increases of 10–24 m in fall and winter, and the estimates in Beijing agreed well with the corresponding results based on AMDAR data.

In the Bransfield Strait (BS), C. wilsoni has received considerable attention as it preys predominantly on krill. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the keystone species in the Southern Ocean, has a versatile feeding strategy, particularly in a highly dynamic environment. The central basin of the BS is a highly dynamic environment, providing an ideal place to explore the application of biochemical tracers in a specialist predator to reveal the diet of its prey. In this study, fatty acid and stable isotopic data demonstrated that the trophic niche of C. wilsoni expanded from late austral summer to early fall, which was primarily reflected in variability in the food availability of krill, i.e., herbivorous features were weakened, benthic-feeding features were strengthened, and omnivorous features showed no significant difference. A highly dynamic hydrography, coupled with an unusual diatom bloom in the BS during 2016, may have resulted in krill's prolonged filtering on diatoms in the water column, which was further reflected in the difference in biochemical tracers of C. wilsoni from late austral summer to early fall.

CFD-DEM simulation of fluorination reaction in fluidized beds with local grid and time refinement method,Journal,Qiu M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.016,2024,"The gas-solid reaction process with wide particle size distribution is extensively used in the chemical engineering field, especially the particle reacts with the gas gradually, such as fluorination reactions in fluidized beds. When the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is used for the coupling simulation of multiphase and polydisperse particle reaction system, the grid size directly affects the accuracy of flow field information and simulation of chemical reaction. Furthermore, particle calculation time step will directly affect the efficiency of coupling calculation. In this work, a local grid and time step refinement method is proposed to simulate multiphase and polydisperse particle fluidization reaction system. In this method, the refined DEM grids are automatically generated in the computational domain around the fine particles, and the detailed fluid phase information is obtained with the interpolation algorithm. In the two-phase coupling process, particles are divided into different groups based on physical properties, each group has its own independent time step. The multistage conical-cylindrical spouted bed is proposed for the fluorination reaction process; the operating gas velocity range of the polydisperse particle system is extended by the new design while the particle size distribution changes with the gas-solid reaction process. It is demonstrated that the local grid and time step refinement method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the traditional CFD-DEM method in the reaction process simulation, which describes a polydisperse particle system with wide particle size distribution.

A numerical and experimental comparison of heat transfer in a quasi two-dimensional packed bed,Journal,Tyslik M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.014,2024,"Heat transfer plays a major role in many industrial processes taking place in packed beds. An accurate and reliable simulation of the heat exchange between particles is therefore crucial for a reliable operation and to optimize the processes in the bed. The discrete ordinates method (DOM) provides an established numerical technique to model radiative heat transfer in granular media that offers the possibility to consider the directional dependence of the radiation propagation. In this work, DOM is compared with Monte Carlo ray tracing, which provides an alternative method for heat transfer simulations. Geometrically simple configurations are used to investigate the influence of the angular discretization on the accuracy of the results and the computation time in both methods. The obtained insights are then transferred to a more complex configuration of a quasi two-dimensional test rig consisting of metal rods for which also experimental results are available. Our results show that both DOM and Monte Carlo ray tracing allow for an accurate simulation of heat transfer in packed beds. Monte Carlo ray tracing requires thereby computation times that are surprisingly competitive (although still somewhat slower) compared to DOM and allows for an easier computation of highly accurate reference solutions. In our preliminary comparison to the experimental test rig, Monte Carlo ray tracing also provides the advantage that it can more easily model highly specular materials such as stainless steel.

Acetylacetone effectively controlled the secondary metabolites of Microcystis aeruginosa under simulated sunlight irradiation,Journal,Wang X.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.004,2024,"Inactivation of cyanobacterial cells and simultaneous control of secondary metabolites is of significant necessity for the treatment of cyanobacteria-laden water. Acetylacetone (AcAc) has been reported a specific algicide to inactivate Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and an effective light activator to degrade pollutants. This study systematically investigated the photodegradation ability of AcAc under xenon (Xe) irradiation on the secondary metabolites of M. aeruginosa, mainly algal organic matter (AOM), especially toxic microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Results showed that AcAc outperformed H2O2 in destructing the protein-like substances, humic acid-like matters, aromatic proteins and fulvic-like substances of AOM. For MC-LR (250 µg/L), 0.05 mmol/L AcAc attained the same degradation efficiency (87.0%) as 0.1 mmol/L H2O2. The degradation mechanism of Xe/AcAc might involve photo-induced energy/electron transfer and formation of carbon center radicals. Alkaline conditions (pH > 9.0) were detrimental to the photoactivity of AcAc, corresponding to the observed degradation rate constant (k1 value) of MC-LR drastically decreasing to 0.0013 min−1 as solution pH exceeded 9.0. The PO43− and HCO3− ions had obvious inhibition effects, whereas NO3− slightly improved k1 value from 0.0277 min−1 to 0.0321 min−1. The presence of AOM did not significantly inhibit MC-LR degradation in Xe/AcAc system. In addition, the biological toxicity of MC-LR was greatly reduced after photoreaction.

The specific surface area of FBC increased from 145.20 to 303.50 m2/g, and oxygen-containing functional groups increased from 1.26 to 1.48 mol/g after freeze-thaw cycles, greatly enhancing the adsorption of DEHP by biochar in the soil.

Compared with FBC, FTC-BC performed better in protecting the normal growth of pakchoi and improving soil properties. In addition, the application of biochar increased the diversity and abundance of bacteria in the DEHP-contaminated soil and changed the composition of the soil bacterial community. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) showed that adding biochar as a soil remediation agent significantly positively impacted soil nutrients and indirectly reduced the DEHP levels in soil and plants by increasing soil microbial diversity.

Significant increases in gaseous pollutants (CO, CH4, N2O, VOCs, etc.) and particles (including black carbon) were found within the wildfire plumes, leading to a reduced air quality. Emission factors, defined as EF (X) = ∆X/∆CO (where, X represents the target species), of various trace gases and black carbon within the young wildfire plumes were determined accordingly and compared with previous studies.

Moreover, we estimated the total carbon and climate-related species (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC) emissions and compared them with fire emission inventories. Current biomass burning emission inventories have uncertainties in estimating small fire burned areas and emissions.

To further understand the unknown photolysis mechanism, the photo-reaction pathways of ground singlet state and the lying excited triplet state of 2-NBA were investigated including the initial and subsequent reactions of proton transfer, direct CO, NO2, and HCO elimination routes in the presence of O2 and NO. Meanwhile, the OH-mediated degradation of 2-NBA proceeded via five H-extraction and six OH-addition channels by indirect mechanism, which follows a succession of reaction steps initiated by the formation of weakly stable intermediate complexes. The H-extraction from the –CHO group was the dominant pathway with a negative activation energy of -1.22 kcal/mol. The calculated rate coefficients at 200–600 K were close to the experimental data in literature within 308–352 K, and the kinetic negative temperature independence was found in both experimental literature and computational results. Interestingly, 2-NBA was favored to be captured onto small TiO2 clusters via six adsorption configurations formed via various combination of three types of bonds of Ti···O, Ti···C, and O···H between the molecularly adsorbed 2-NBA and TiO2 clusters. Comparison indicted that the chemisorptions of aldehyde oxygen have largest energies. The results suggested adsorption conformations have a respectable impact on the catalysis barrier.

"Experimental and theoretical insight into carbamazepine degradation by chlorine‐based advanced oxidation processes: Efficiency, energy consumption, mechanism and DBPs formation",Journal,Liu C.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.012,2024,"Chlorine has been widely used in different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for micropollutants removal. In this study, different chlorine-based AOPs, namely medium pressure (MP) UV/chlorine, low pressure (LP) UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, were compared for carbamazepine (CBZ) removal efficiency, energy consumption, and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. All three processes could achieve nearly 100% CBZ removal, while the reaction time needed by in-situ chlorination was double the time required by UV/chlorine processes. The energy consumed per magnitude of CBZ removed (EE/O) of MP UV/chlorine was 13 times higher than that of LP UV/chlorine, and relative to that of in-situ chlorination process. Accordingly, MP and LP UV/chlorine processes generated one to two orders of magnitude more hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCS) than in-situ chlorination. Besides, RCS were the dominant reactive species, contributing to 78.3%, 75.6%, and 71.6% of CBZ removal in MP, LP UV/chlorine, and in-situ chlorination, respectively. According to the Gibbs free energy barriers between CBZ and RCS/•OH calculated based on density functional theory (DFT), RCS had more reaction routes with CBZ and showed lower energy barrier in the main CBZ degradation pathways like epoxidation and formation of iminostilbene. When applied to secondary wastewater effluent, UV/chlorine and in-situ chlorination produced overall DBPs ranging from 104.77 to 135.41 µg/L. However, the production of chlorate during UV/chlorine processes was 15 times higher than that during in-situ chlorination.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002115,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Coal Processing and Efficient Clean Utilization'}"
Ferrihydrite transformation impacted by coprecipitation of lignin: Inhibition or facilitation?,Journal,Liu L.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.05.016,2024,"Lignin is a common soil organic matter that is present in soils, but its effect on the transformation of ferrihydrite (Fh) remains unclear. Organic matter is generally assumed to inhibit Fh transformation. However, lignin can reduce Fh to Fe(II), in which Fe(II)-catalyzed Fh transformation occurs. Herein, the effects of lignin on Fh transformation were investigated at 75°C as a function of the lignin/Fh mass ratio (0-0.2), pH (4-8) and aging time (0-96 hr). The results of Fh-lignin samples (mass ratios = 0.1) aged at different pH values showed that for Fh-lignin the time of Fh transformation into secondary crystalline minerals was significantly shortened at pH 6 when compared with pure Fh, and the Fe(II)-accelerated transformation of Fh was strongly dependent on pH. Under pH 6, at low lignin/Fh mass ratios (0.05-0.1), the time of secondary mineral formation decreased with increasing lignin content. For high lignosulfonate-content material (lignin:Fh = 0.2), Fh did not transform into secondary minerals, indicating that lignin content plays a major role in Fh transformation. In addition, lignin affected the pathway of Fh transformation by inhibiting goethite formation and facilitating hematite formation. The effect of coprecipitation of lignin on Fh transformation should be useful in understanding the complex iron and carbon cycles in a soil environment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223002176,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Central South University'}"

The Ag hardly changed the carbon nitride's layered and porous physical structure. AgUTCN exhibited efficient visible-light photocatalytic performances in the degradation of various recalcitrant pollutants, eliminations of 85% were achieved by visible-light irradiation for 1 hr. Doping with Ag improved the photocatalytic performance of UTCN by narrowing the forbidden band gap from 2.49 to 2.36 eV and suppressing electron–hole pair recombination. In addition, Ag doping facilitated O2 adsorption on UTCN by decreasing the adsorption energy from −0.2 to −2.22 eV and favored the formation of O2·−.

A combined evaluation of the characteristics and antibiotic resistance induction potential of antibiotic wastewater during the treatment process,Journal,Miao S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.002,2024,"Antibiotic wastewater contains a variety of pollutant stressors that can induce and promote antibiotic resistance (AR) when released into the environment. Although these substances are mostly in concentrations lower than those known to induce AR individually, it is possible that antibiotic wastewater discharge might still promote the AR transmission risk via additive or synergistic effects. However, the comprehensive effect of antibiotic wastewater on AR development has rarely been evaluated, and its treatment efficiency remains unknown. Here, samples were collected from different stages of a cephalosporin production wastewater treatment plant, and the potential AR induction effect of their chemical mixtures was explored through the exposure of the antibiotic-sensitive E. coli K12 strain. Incubation with raw cephalosporin production wastewater significantly promoted mutation rates (3.6 × 103–9.3 × 103-fold) and minimum inhibition concentrations (6.0–6.7-fold) of E. coli against ampicillin and chloramphenicol. This may be attributed to the inhibition effect and oxidative stress of cephalosporin wastewater on E. coli. The AR induction effect of cephalosporin wastewater decreased after the coagulation sedimentation treatment and was completely removed after the full treatment process. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the reduction in the AR induction effect had a strong positive correlation with the removal of organics and biological toxicity. This indicates that the antibiotic wastewater treatment had a collaborative processing effect of conventional pollutants, toxicity, and the AR induction effect.

Development and evaluation of an online monitoring single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection,Journal,Yao W.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.010,2024,"We developed a single-particle optical particle counter with polarization detection (SOPC) for the real-time measurement of the optical size and depolarization ratio (defined as the ratio of the vertical component to the parallel component of backward scattering) of atmospheric particles, the polarization ratio (DR) value can reflect the irregularity of the particles. The SOPC can detect aerosol particles with size larger than 500 nm and the maximum particle count rate reaches ∼1.8 × 105 particles per liter. The SOPC uses a modulated polarization laser to measure the optical size of particles according to forward scattering signal and the DR value of the particles by backward S and P signal components.

Elaborations of the influencing factors on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols in a heavily polluted urban area of China,Journal,Wang S.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.022,2024,"In this study, online water-soluble inorganic ions were detected to deduce the formation mechanism of secondary inorganic aerosol in Xianyang, China during wintertime. The dominant inorganic ions of sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), and ammonium (NH4+) (the sum of those is abbreviated as SNA) accounted for 17%, 21%, and 12% of PM2.5 mass, respectively. While the air quality deteriorated from excellent to poor grades, the precursor gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) of SO42- increased and then decreased with a fluctuation, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3), precursors of NO3− and NH4+, and SNA show increasing trends. Meteorological factors including boundary layer height (BLH), temperature, and wind speed also show decline trends, except relative humidity (RH). Meanwhile, the secondary conversion ratio shows a remarkable increasing trend, indicating that there was a strong secondary transformation. From the perspective of chemical mechanisms, RH is positively correlated with sulfur oxidation ratios (SOR), nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR), and ammonia conversion ratios, representing that the increase of humidity could promote the generation of SNA. Notably, SOR and NOR were also positively related to the ammonia. On the one hand, the low wind speed and BLH led to the accumulation of pollutants. On the other hand, the increases of RH and ammonia promoted more formations of SNA and PM2.5.

Facile low-temperature supercritical carbonization method to prepare high-loading nickel single atom catalysts for efficient photodegradation of tetracycline,Journal,Qiao H.,10.1016/j.jes.2023.03.020,2024,"Environmental photocatalysis is a promising technology for treating antibiotics in wastewater. In this study, a supercritical carbonization method was developed to synthesize a single-atom photocatalyst with a high loading of Ni (above 5 wt.%) anchored on a carbon-nitrogen-silicate substrate for the efficient photodegradation of a ubiquitous environmental contaminant of tetracycline (TC). The photocatalyst was prepared from an easily obtained metal-biopolymer-inorganic supramolecular hydrogel, followed by supercritical drying and carbonization treatment. The low-temperature (300°C) supercritical ethanol treatment prevents the excessive structural degradation of hydrogel and greatly reduces the metal clustering and aggregation, which contributed to the high Ni loading. Atomic characterizations confirmed that Ni was present at isolated sites and stabilized by Ni-N and Ni-O bonds in a Ni-(N/O)6C/SiC configuration. A 5% Ni-C-Si catalyst, which performed the best among the studied catalysts, exhibited a wide visible light response with a narrow bandgap of 1.45 eV that could efficiently and repeatedly catalyze the oxidation of TC with a conversion rate of almost 100% within 40 min. The reactive species trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests demonstrated that the h+, and ·O2− were mainly responsible for TC degradation.

Pearson correlation analysis showed that pH was the main control factor affecting the non-residue fractions of HMs. Therefore, acid production from high sulfur CG reduced soil pH by 2-3, which indirectly promoted the activity of HMs. Finally, the conceptual model of HMs contamination at the CG site was proposed, which can be useful for the development of ecological remediation strategies.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006374,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'University of Science and Technology Beijing'}"
The biochemical behavior and mechanism of uranium(Ⅵ) bioreduction induced by natural Bacillus thuringiensis,Journal,Chen S.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.001,2024,"For a broader understanding of uranium migration affected by microorganisms in natural anaerobic environment, the bioreduction of uranium(Ⅵ) (U(Ⅵ)) was revealed in Bacillus thuringiensis, a dominant bacterium strain with potential of uranium-tolerant isolated from uranium contaminated soil. The reduction behavior was systematically investigated by the quantitative analysis of U(Ⅳ) in bacteria, and mechanism was inferred from the pathway of electron transmission. Under anaerobic conditions, appropriate biomass and sodium lactate as electron donor, reduction behavior of U(Ⅵ) induced by B. thuringiensis was restricted by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, which was directly affected by the initial pH, temperature and initial U(Ⅵ) concentration of bioreduction system. Bioreduction of U(Ⅵ) was driven by the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from enzymatic reaction of sodium lactate with various dehydrogenase. The transmission of the electrons from bacteria to U(Ⅵ) was mainly supported by the intracellular NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquinone system, this process could maintain the biological activity of cells.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074222006167,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Sichuan University'}"

However, whether this technology efficiently removes the pollutants to prevent secondary pollution and health risk is still unclear. Here, the photodegradation processes of three xylenes were compared under designed reaction atmospheres and light sources. Xe lamp showed poor photodegradation ability toward xylenes, no matter in N2 or N2+O2 system, while much higher photodegradation performance of xylenes were obtained under ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, especially in N2+O2+VUV system, where 97.9% of m-xylene, 99.0% of o-xylene or 87.5% of p-xylene with the initial concentration of 860 mg/m3 was removed within 240 min. The xylenes underwent three processes of photo-isomerization, photodecomposition and photo-oxidation to produce intermediates of aromatics, alkanes and carbonyls. Among them, the photo-isomerization products showed the highest concentration percentage (e.g., ≥50% in o-xylene system), confirming that photo-isomerization reaction was the dominated photodegradation process of xylenes. Moreover, these isomerized products not only contributed about 97% and 91% to the formation potential of O3 (OFP) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAFP), but also displayed obvious non-carcinogenic risk, although one of photodecomposition product—benzene showed the highest occupational exposure risk. Therefore, the secondary pollution and health risks of photodegradation products of xylenes were non-ignorable, although the OFP, SOAFP and health risks of the generated products reduced at least 4.5 times in comparison with that of the degraded xylenes. The findings are helpful for the appropriate application of this technology in the purification of industrial organic waste gas.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1001074223000025,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Guangdong University of Technology'}"

Nearly 89% articles had a mixture of Ag- and Zn-containing NPs and the teethers had relatively high Ag and Zn contents (up to 501 and 254 µg/g, respectively). Steam disinfection caused rubber decomposition into micro(nano)plastics (0.54−15.7 µm) and NP release from the interior of bulk rubber and micro-sized plastics, thus enhancing the IVBA of Ag and Zn by up to 5.5 times.

However, researches on the damage of tebuconazole exposure to energy metabolism and the related molecular mechanisms are limited. In the present study, male C57BL/6 mice were treated with tebuconazole at different low concentrations for 4 weeks. The results indicated that tebuconazole could accumulate in the heart and further induce the decrease of ATP content in the mouse heart. Importantly, tebuconazole induced an obvious shift in substrate utilization of fatty acid and glucose by disrupting their corresponding transporters (GLUT1, GLUT4, CD36, FABP3 and FATP1) expression, and significantly repressed the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (Gabpa and Tfam) and oxidative phosphorylation (CS, Ndufa4, Sdhb, Cox5a and Atp5b) related genes in a dose-dependent manner.

The sensitivity of meteorological changes to identical aerosol loads varied in the order July > January > October and April. Then, the cooling and stabilizing effects of aerosols further led to increases in PM2.5, by 23.0, 3.4, 4.6, and 7.3 µg/m3 respectively in the four months. The sensitivity of the effect of aerosols on PM2.5 was greatest in January rather than in July, contrary to the effect on meteorology. Moreover, a negative linear relation was observed between daily BLH reductions and aerosol loads in fall and winter, and between PM2.5 increases and aerosol loads in all seasons. With the PM2.5 pollution improvements in this region, the aerosol radiative forcing was effectively reduced. This should result in daily BLH increases of 10–24 m in fall and winter, and the estimates in Beijing agreed well with the corresponding results based on AMDAR data.

In the Bransfield Strait (BS), C. wilsoni has received considerable attention as it preys predominantly on krill. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the keystone species in the Southern Ocean, has a versatile feeding strategy, particularly in a highly dynamic environment. The central basin of the BS is a highly dynamic environment, providing an ideal place to explore the application of biochemical tracers in a specialist predator to reveal the diet of its prey. In this study, fatty acid and stable isotopic data demonstrated that the trophic niche of C. wilsoni expanded from late austral summer to early fall, which was primarily reflected in variability in the food availability of krill, i.e., herbivorous features were weakened, benthic-feeding features were strengthened, and omnivorous features showed no significant difference. A highly dynamic hydrography, coupled with an unusual diatom bloom in the BS during 2016, may have resulted in krill's prolonged filtering on diatoms in the water column, which was further reflected in the difference in biochemical tracers of C. wilsoni from late austral summer to early fall.

CFD-DEM simulation of fluorination reaction in fluidized beds with local grid and time refinement method,Journal,Qiu M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.016,2024,"The gas-solid reaction process with wide particle size distribution is extensively used in the chemical engineering field, especially the particle reacts with the gas gradually, such as fluorination reactions in fluidized beds. When the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is used for the coupling simulation of multiphase and polydisperse particle reaction system, the grid size directly affects the accuracy of flow field information and simulation of chemical reaction. Furthermore, particle calculation time step will directly affect the efficiency of coupling calculation. In this work, a local grid and time step refinement method is proposed to simulate multiphase and polydisperse particle fluidization reaction system. In this method, the refined DEM grids are automatically generated in the computational domain around the fine particles, and the detailed fluid phase information is obtained with the interpolation algorithm. In the two-phase coupling process, particles are divided into different groups based on physical properties, each group has its own independent time step. The multistage conical-cylindrical spouted bed is proposed for the fluorination reaction process; the operating gas velocity range of the polydisperse particle system is extended by the new design while the particle size distribution changes with the gas-solid reaction process. It is demonstrated that the local grid and time step refinement method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the traditional CFD-DEM method in the reaction process simulation, which describes a polydisperse particle system with wide particle size distribution.

A numerical and experimental comparison of heat transfer in a quasi two-dimensional packed bed,Journal,Tyslik M.,10.1016/j.partic.2023.03.014,2024,"Heat transfer plays a major role in many industrial processes taking place in packed beds. An accurate and reliable simulation of the heat exchange between particles is therefore crucial for a reliable operation and to optimize the processes in the bed. The discrete ordinates method (DOM) provides an established numerical technique to model radiative heat transfer in granular media that offers the possibility to consider the directional dependence of the radiation propagation. In this work, DOM is compared with Monte Carlo ray tracing, which provides an alternative method for heat transfer simulations. Geometrically simple configurations are used to investigate the influence of the angular discretization on the accuracy of the results and the computation time in both methods. The obtained insights are then transferred to a more complex configuration of a quasi two-dimensional test rig consisting of metal rods for which also experimental results are available. Our results show that both DOM and Monte Carlo ray tracing allow for an accurate simulation of heat transfer in packed beds. Monte Carlo ray tracing requires thereby computation times that are surprisingly competitive (although still somewhat slower) compared to DOM and allows for an easier computation of highly accurate reference solutions. In our preliminary comparison to the experimental test rig, Monte Carlo ray tracing also provides the advantage that it can more easily model highly specular materials such as stainless steel.

Acetylacetone effectively controlled the secondary metabolites of Microcystis aeruginosa under simulated sunlight irradiation,Journal,Wang X.,10.1016/j.jes.2022.12.004,2024,"Inactivation of cyanobacterial cells and simultaneous control of secondary metabolites is of significant necessity for the treatment of cyanobacteria-laden water. Acetylacetone (AcAc) has been reported a specific algicide to inactivate Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and an effective light activator to degrade pollutants. This study systematically investigated the photodegradation ability of AcAc under xenon (Xe) irradiation on the secondary metabolites of M. aeruginosa, mainly algal organic matter (AOM), especially toxic microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Results showed that AcAc outperformed H2O2 in destructing the protein-like substances, humic acid-like matters, aromatic proteins and fulvic-like substances of AOM. For MC-LR (250 µg/L), 0.05 mmol/L AcAc attained the same degradation efficiency (87.0%) as 0.1 mmol/L H2O2. The degradation mechanism of Xe/AcAc might involve photo-induced energy/electron transfer and formation of carbon center radicals. Alkaline conditions (pH > 9.0) were detrimental to the photoactivity of AcAc, corresponding to the observed degradation rate constant (k1 value) of MC-LR drastically decreasing to 0.0013 min−1 as solution pH exceeded 9.0. The PO43− and HCO3− ions had obvious inhibition effects, whereas NO3− slightly improved k1 value from 0.0277 min−1 to 0.0321 min−1. The presence of AOM did not significantly inhibit MC-LR degradation in Xe/AcAc system. In addition, the biological toxicity of MC-LR was greatly reduced after photoreaction.

The specific surface area of FBC increased from 145.20 to 303.50 m2/g, and oxygen-containing functional groups increased from 1.26 to 1.48 mol/g after freeze-thaw cycles, greatly enhancing the adsorption of DEHP by biochar in the soil.

Compared with FBC, FTC-BC performed better in protecting the normal growth of pakchoi and improving soil properties. In addition, the application of biochar increased the diversity and abundance of bacteria in the DEHP-contaminated soil and changed the composition of the soil bacterial community. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) showed that adding biochar as a soil remediation agent significantly positively impacted soil nutrients and indirectly reduced the DEHP levels in soil and plants by increasing soil microbial diversity.

Significant increases in gaseous pollutants (CO, CH4, N2O, VOCs, etc.) and particles (including black carbon) were found within the wildfire plumes, leading to a reduced air quality. Emission factors, defined as EF (X) = ∆X/∆CO (where, X represents the target species), of various trace gases and black carbon within the young wildfire plumes were determined accordingly and compared with previous studies.

Moreover, we estimated the total carbon and climate-related species (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC) emissions and compared them with fire emission inventories. Current biomass burning emission inventories have uncertainties in estimating small fire burned areas and emissions.

ESIPT-based fluorescent enhanced probes prompted by methylated β-cyclodextrin for the detection of thiophenols,Journal,Peng H.Y.,10.1016/j.saa.2023.123012,2023,"Thiophenol and its derivatives are compounds with high toxicity to organisms and environmental pollution, so it is necessary to detect the level of thiophenols in the environment and biological samples. The probes 1a-b were obtained by introducing the 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether group into diethylcoumarin–salicylaldehyde based compounds. And they can form host-guest compounds with methylated β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CD), the association constants of inclusion complexes are 49.2 M−1, 125 M−1 respectively. The fluorescence intensities of probes 1a-b at 600 nm (1a) and 670 nm (1b) increased significantly in thiophenols detection. Meanwhile, with the addition of M-β-CD, the hydrophobic cavity of M-β-CD significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of probes 1a-b, thus the detection limits of probes 1a-b to thiophenols were reduced from 410 nM, 365 nM to 62 nM, 33 nM respectively. Whereas, the good selectivity and short response time of probes 1a-b towards thiophenols was not affected in the presence of M-β-CD. Moreover, probes 1a-b were used for further water sample detection and HeLa cell imaging experiments due to their good response to thiophenols and the results suggested that probes 1a-b had the potential to detect the content of thiophenols in water samples and living cells.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386142523006972,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Soochow University'}"
Continuous and discrete-point Rayleigh reflectors inscribed by femtosecond pulses in singlemode and multimode fibers,Journal,Dostovalov A.,10.1016/j.optlastec.2023.109692,2023,"In this paper we present the results on structures inscription to enhance Rayleigh backscattering up to +60 dB in the wide spectral range in singlemode and multimode fibers by tightly focused femtosecond laser radiation. Continuous and discrete-point artificial Rayleigh reflectors were produced and optimized in terms of backscattering enhancement level and insertion losses. The linewidth narrowing of single-frequency DFB Er-doped fiber laser based on the developed 40-cm long artificial Rayleigh reflector in singlemode fiber was demonstrated. Moreover, the various types (1D, 2D, 3D) of localized Rayleigh reflectors were inscribed in the multimode GRIN fiber revealing the strong dependence of backscattering signal on the positions of scattering points in the fiber core cross-section and on the modes composition incident on the reflector. Due to the random distributed feedback based on the developed multimode Rayleigh reflectors, we observed random lasing in 1-km MM GRIN fiber with good (M2 < 3) beam quality at much lower threshold power than that for lasing based on natural Rayleigh backscattering.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030399223005856,"{'country': 'Russian Federation', 'school': 'Institute of Automation and Electrometry of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences'}"
The effect of minor addition of Mn in AA7075 Al–Zn–Mg–Cu aluminum alloys on microstructural evolution and mechanical properties in warm forming and paint baking processes,Journal,Tai C.L.,10.1016/j.ijlmm.2023.04.001,2023,"The microstructures and mechanical properties in the peak ageing condition, warm forming process, and paint baking process of two Al–Zn–Mg–Cu aluminum alloys, which possessed the same base compositions but different levels of Mn (0 and 0.24 wt%), have been investigated. The results show that Mn addition can hardly refine the grain size (around 20 μm) in AA7075 aluminum alloy in warm forming and paint baking processes. Mn-free and Mn-containing alloys subjected to all three processes possess nano-precipitates of nearly the same size, indicating that Mn addition does not influence the nano-precipitate evolution in the aluminum matrix. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results of dispersoids show that dispersoids in Mn-bearing specimens are enriched in Mn and depleted in Zn and Mg. The Zn and Mg expelled from dispersoids in Mn-containing specimens into the aluminum matrix presumably formed Zn- and Mg-rich zones around the dispersoids, which improved the precipitate transformation reation from GPII to η′ phase at the boundaries between aluminum matrix and dispersoids. Although the solid solution strengthening effect triggered by Mn addition might be less effective because of the formation of dispersoids, the slight enhancement of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in Mn-containing specimens rather than in Mn-free specimens in all states can be attributed to the formation of nano-precipitates around the dispersoids.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2588840423000124,"{'country': 'Taiwan', 'school': 'National Taiwan University'}"
Inactivating Escherichia coli using hexagonal array of narrow bandwidth of violet-blue light emitting diode,Journal,Pham T.T.,10.1016/j.cscee.2023.100389,2023,"Antibiotic resistance, in general, and multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli, in particular, have caused a significant burden on modern therapeutics. In order to find alternatives besides researching new antibiotics, numerous antimicrobial methods have been used, and light-emitting diode (LED) emitting light in blue regions is increasing attention. This work utilized a LED array of six hexagonal III-Nitride based-LEDs with a wavelength of 404.2 nm (bandwidth ± 7.2 nm) to demonstrate the antimicrobial photodynamic effect on E. coli. Bacterial cultures were inactivated under blue light LED array at 2 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. In addition, the correlation between dose energy, exposure distance, and irradiation time was also evaluated. A complete inactivation was achieved at 2 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm with an irradiation time of 16 min, 35 min, and 35 min, respectively. When exposed at 10 cm and irradiated for up to 90 min, the inactivation was only 90% (equivalent to 106 CFU/mL) and showed fluctuation. Regardless of the energy dosage, less energy was released at a greater distance, in which at 7 cm, the LED emitted 160 J/cm2 compared to over 850 J/cm2 of 2 cm distance. However, the irradiation time was increased from 16 min to 35 min. Thus, the results showed that the antibacterial effect of the LEDs was dependent on the distance, the irradiation time, and the energy dose. This study suggests the potential of 405 nm LEDs as antimicrobial methods for preventing antibiotic resistance. Noteworthy that a low energy dose, at an exposure distance of 10 cm, prevents the complete inactivation due to hormesis.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2666016423000944,"{'country': 'Viet Nam', 'school': 'Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology - HCMUT'}"
Laser processing of chalcogenide glasses using laser fields with a spatially varying polarization distribution,Journal,Porfirev A.P.,10.1016/j.optlastec.2023.109716,2023,"We present an approach for laser processing of chalcogenide glasses (CGs) using laser fields with a spatially varying polarization distribution generated using a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) depolarizer (a patterned microretarder array). The used LCP depolarizer transforms a linearly polarized Gaussian laser beam into a laser beam with the same intensity distribution and a space variant polarization distribution. The polarization sensitivity of CGs results in the movement of the material on the micro/macroscale according to the local polarization distribution of the transformed laser beam and leads to the formation of surface relief gratings (SRGs). The developed approach made it possible to control the height of the formed relief, the period of the formed grooves and their orientation. We fabricated complex variants of space variant SRGs with a discrete and continuous reorientation of the grooves, demonstrating the high potential of this fabrication method.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030399223006096,"{'country': 'Russian Federation', 'school': 'Federal Scientific Research Center ""Crystallography and photonics"" of Russian Academy of Sciences'}"

Spintronic terahertz polarization programmable system for information encoding,Journal,Li H.,10.1016/j.optlastec.2023.109717,2023,"Terahertz (THz) wave as an important electromagnetic wave has been increasingly applied in wireless communication and imaging sensing technology. It has been an increasingly practical application. Ultra-high data rates in communication technology push toward a broadband, controllable polarization, and multiple transmission channels signal sources. Here, we propose a programmable polarization spintronics terahertz source (PP-STS), in which contains a controllable polarization spintronic THz emitter and a microcontroller unit. The PP-STS not only can generate THz waves with wide frequency bandwidth, but also has the function of switching the orthogonal linear polarization state of the generated THz waves flexibly. By coding the microcontroller unit, the designed PP-SPS can directly program the orthogonal linear polarization states as a series of information to transmit. To achieve the interconversions between digital codes and the THz polarization information, an optimum matching THz polarization beam splitter (THz-PBS) is also designed via simulations and experiments. The THz-PBS, as a decoder, can accurately split the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes into two THz detectors. At last, a coding and decoding prototype system of spintronic THz polarization is built by integrating the PP-STS, the THz-PBS and two THz detectors. The send and receive information with high speed and accuracy are verified in this prototype system as well. We believe that our work takes THz applications for multiplexing communications one step further and sheds light on commercializing the PP-STS with exciting manufacturing lines for efficient and economical THz polarization technology.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030399223006102,"{'country': 'China', 'school': 'Xiangtan University'}"
