The current lithium-ion batteries are not suitable for such conditions without significant heating or thermal protection, as the electrolyte can freeze and the desolvation energy barrier for the Li-ion is high. To address this issue, a new type of ternary fluorinated electrolyte has been developed, which has an extremely low freezing point (FP) and enhanced charge transfer kinetics compared to the standard commercial electrolyte (COM). The F-FFN electrolyte showed superior performance and was comprised of a single lithium salt, lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSI), dissolved in a three-solvent mixture of a highly polar fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), intermediately polar methyl (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) carbonate (FEMC), and weakly polar nonaflurobutyl methyl ether (NONA) (FP = −135 °C). This specific solvent mixture was chosen to take advantage of the differences in dielectric constants between the three solvents, with NONA serving as a non-polar diluent to decrease the freezing point and charge transfer activation energy (Ea,CT). The optimized F-FFN electrolyte retained 61% of its room temperature (RT) capacity at −50 °C with a low Ea,CT of 55.71 kJ mol−1 compared to COM, which retained only 25% of its RT capacity at −25 °C. Excellent LT performance for F-FFN electrolyte in a Li‖LiFePO4 cell is attributed to the tailored solvation shell incorporating a higher fraction of lithium salt anions compared to T-FFN, which had more unassociated anions. The cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of the F-FFN electrolyte features a higher fraction of LiF and Li2CO3, which helps to allow for a superior subzero temperature performance over the T-FFN and COM electrolytes organic polymer and carboxyl based CEIs. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activation energy; Amides; Charge transfer; Freezing; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Organic polymers; Solvents; Temperature; 'current; Freezing point; Growing demand; Interfacial kinetic; Lithium salts; Low temperature performance; Lows-temperatures; Solvent mixtures; Storage solutions; Ultra low temperatures; Electrolytes; activation energy; electrolyte; energy storage; freezing; heating; kinetics; lithium; low temperature; polymer; Arctic",,,,,,"I would like to acknowledge the help provided by Zheng Li and Soohwan Kim.

The cell’s characteristics prior to, during, and after a destructive event are important in developing preventive and mitigating hazard steps. A novel measuring system based on isothermal calorimetry has been developed and utilized to further understand the worst-case event produced by large format electrochemical cells. This system allows for the containment of the reaction and its products while measuring the pressure and release rate of the gaseous product, as well as a complete thermal profile of the reaction. This paper provides a description of the calorimeter, calibration test results on its performance, test results, and empirical model from a selection of cells tested. The cells utilized in this developmental testing were Lithium Iron Phosphate and Lithium Cobalt Oxide cells ranging from 6 to 38 Ampere hour capacities and approximately 40 mm diameter, 170 mm height, and 0.35 kg each. This analytical system allows for a wide range of cells, chemistries, failure mechanisms and testing environments for lithium-ion cells, static or under load. Empirical models developed from this flexible and adaptive system will enable researchers to compare larger samples across material property boundaries to better predict the outcome of destructive chemical reactions. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Hazards; Heat flow calorimetry; Lithium-ion; Overcharge; Safety","Calorimeters; Calorimetry; Cells; Cobalt compounds; Combustion; Cytology; Electrolytes; Failure (mechanical); Hazards; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Physiology; Condition; Empirical model; Failure events; Heat flow calorimetry; Highest temperature; Isothermal calorimetry; Large-format; Lithium ions; Measuring systems; Overcharge; Lithium compounds",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-18-1-2397; Purdue University, PU; Cranfield University","This research has been advanced with the assistance of the NSWC Crane Power and Energy Division, Specialized Munitions Division, Purdue University and Cranfield University as part of the Masters of Defense Engineering and Technology program with specialization in expeditionary warfare.

The chemical analysis of smoke samples is challenging due to the adiabatic temperature of the pyrotechnic combustion and the molecular complexity of the physically dispersed reaction products. Presented here is the characterization of the reaction byproducts of a simulant Mk124 smoke signal on a multigram scale, which contain the dye disperse red 9 (1-(methylamino)anthraquinone), by ambient ionization mass spectrometry. Our previous work has examined the thermal decomposition of a simplified smoke system consisting of disperse red 9, potassium chlorate, and sucrose by anaerobic pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry performed at the laboratory milligram scale. The results from the lab scale test were compared with a fully functioned Mk124 in the field. To achieve this, Mk124 smokes were functioned in the presence of sampling swabs that collected byproduct residues from the smoke plume in the ambient environment. These swabs were then analyzed using ambient ionization mass spectrometry to identify the expended pyrotechnic residues, with particular interest in halogenated species. Previous work determined the toxicity of unforeseen byproducts identified on the laboratory scale, which were also detected in the field demonstrating the correlation of the laboratory testing to the fielded systems.

Two main mechanisms have been proposed to increase the burning rate: (1) plasma enhancement by the presence of low-ionization threshold sodium and (2) the dielectric thermal runaway heating of metallic-oxide products. To examine the mechanisms of microwave energy deposition in the solid propellant burning strands, optical emission measurements were made during the application of a 2.46 GHz, 870 W microwave field in a single-mode microwave resonator. Flame temperature measurements are made via gas-phase AlO B2Σ+→X2Σ+(Δv=−1) electronic emission spectroscopy, spatially-resolved two-color imaging pyrometry of the condensed phase, and spatially-resolved two-line sodium emission thermometry. These experiments indicate an increase in the gas phase AlO temperature of ∼130 K, and a ∼1200 K increase in the sodium gas-phase temperature during the application of the microwave field. Gray body condensed-phase temperatures of burning aluminum particles indicated little temperature change, but the product plume temperature increased by ∼700 K. These temperature measurements of the vapor and condensed phase products indicate several important pathways for the thermalization of the field energy throughout the propellant flame structure, offering opportunities for further optimization of electromagnetically tunable energetic material combustion. © 2023 The Combustion Institute","Aluminum combustion; Composite propellant; Emission spectroscopy; Plasma-assisted combustion","Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Gases; Ionization of gases; Microwave resonators; Sodium; Temperature measurement; Thermometers; Alkali-doped propellants; Aluminium combustions; Burning rate; Condensed phase; Condensed phasis; Gas-phases; Microwave field; Microwave-assisted; Plasma assisted combustion; Spatially resolved; Combustion; alkali; aluminum; metal oxide; propellant; sodium; Article; combustion; flame; heating; ionization; microwave radiation; plume; pyrometry; spectroscopy; temperature measurement; thermometry; vapor",,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; sodium, 7440-23-5",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-18-1-2380; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NNX16AL88H; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR: FA9550-15-1-0195, FA9550-15-1-0481","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Dr. Mitat Birkan of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [ FA9550-15-1-0481 and FA9550-15-1-0195 ].

A ship’s motion can promote emulsification or coalescence, depending on the surfactant type and concentration. This study investigates the effects of motion on model bilge water O/W emulsions, which has yet to be published in the literature. Mineral oil, 0.42 M NaCl DI-water, and a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) or an anionic surfactant (sodium lauryl ether sulfate, SLES) served as a model bilge water emulsion. The stability was characterized under static and dynamic conditions via optical microscopy and light diffraction. Ship motion was mimicked using a three-dimensional rocker. Under static conditions, the surfactant-to-oil ratio (S/O) needed to stabilize the emulsions for up to 20 days was 0.2 for SLES and 0.1 for Triton X-100. During dynamic ageing at 12 rpm, the S/O to promote emulsification was 0.1 for SLES and 0.2 for Triton X-100. At 30 rpm, the S/O to promote emulsification was 0.02 for SLES and 0.1 for Triton X-100, suggesting a complex interplay between surfactant concentration and energy input. These results expand on existing knowledge of bilge water and potentially reducing ocean pollution. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","coalescence; dynamic ageing; emulsions; salt; stability; surfactants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cheryan, M., Rajagopalan, N., Membrane processing of oily streams.

Here we show silver deposition onto plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs) during LP-TEM is dominated by water radiolysis-induced chemical reduction. Silver was observed with LP-TEM to form bipyramidal shells at higher surfactant coverage and tip-preferential lobes at lower surfactant coverage. Ex situ silver photodeposition formed nanometer-thick shells on AuNRs with preferential deposition in inter-rod gaps, while chemical reduction deposited silver at AuNR tips at low surfactant coverage and formed pyramidal shells at higher surfactant coverage, consistent with LP-TEM. Silver deposition locations during LP-TEM were inconsistent with simulated near-field enhancement and hot electron generation hot spots. Collectively, the results indicate chemical reduction dominated during LP-TEM, indicating observation of plasmonic hot electron-induced photoreduction will necessitate suppression of radiolysis. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",,"Deposition; Electrons; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hot electrons; Metal nanoparticles; Nanorods; Petroleum tar; Plasmonics; Radiation chemistry; Surface active agents; Chemical reduction; Gold nanorod; Liquid Phase; Liquid phasis; Phase transmission; Plasmonic nanoparticle; Plasmonics; Postsynthetic modification; Relative contribution; Silver deposition; Radiolysis",,,,,"Army Research Laboratory, ARL: CRADA 14-052-22; American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, ACS PRF: 61111-DNI10; DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, DEVCOM ARL","T.J.W. and A.C. acknowledge support from the Petroleum Research Fund (#61111-DNI10) and from the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute 2021 Hulka Energy Research Graduate Fellowship.

To tackle the adversaries, it is of utmost importance to understand potential techniques they may use to exploit network vulnerabilities. Attack graph has always been a crucial tool for network vulnerability analysis. However, the current state-of-the-art attack graph can not predict adversarial techniques. To overcome the gap, we utilize the MITRE ATT&CK matrix in this work and map the techniques with the attack graph node descriptions. We first formulate a comprehensive dataset from ATT&CK consisting of all the adversarial strategies, subtechniques, associated tactics, and mitigation for the enterprise network. We then capture the attack graph node descriptions and apply the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to map the attack techniques with the available node descriptions. Next, we generate the cosine similarity to determine an adversary's top methods to attack a network. We then map those techniques with the associated tactics and mitigation strategies as enumerated in the ATT&CK matrix. Finally, we illustrate the analysis using a networked system's attack graph. This proposed method would help identify and validate adversarial techniques and guide in selecting mitigation mechanisms for security enhancement. © 2023 IEEE.","adverasial techniques; ATT&CK; attack graph; Cybersecurity; mitigations; networked system; TF-IDF","Cybersecurity; Graph theory; Inverse problems; Network security; Text processing; Adverasial technique; ATT&CK; Attack graph; Cyber security; matrix; Mitigation; Network vulnerability; Networked systems; Potential techniques; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Matrix algebra",,,,,"W911NF-20-2-0277; Army Research Laboratory, ARL","This work was supported in part by the DoD Center of Excellence in AI and Machine Learning (CoE-AIML) under Contract Number W911NF-20-2-0277 with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, M., Panda, S., Xenakis, C., Panaousis, E., Mitre att&ckdriven cyber risk assessment (2022) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 1-10; Xiong, W., Legrand, E., Aberg, O., Lagerström, R., Cyber security threat modeling based on the mitre enterprise att&ck matrix (2022) Software and Systems Modeling, 21 (1), pp. 157-177; Manocha, H., Srivastava, A., Verma, C., Gupta, R., Bansal, B., (2021) Security assessment rating framework for enterprises using mitre att&ck matrix; Kwon, R., Ashley, T., Castleberry, J., McKenzie, P., Gourisetti, S.N.G., Cyber threat dictionary using mitre att&ck matrix and nist cybersecurity framework mapping (2020) 2020 Resilience Week (RWS).

In radar and communication systems, quantum technologies have been explored in an effort to increase the correlation performance in the low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) regime. While this increase has been shown both mathematically and in the laboratory using bipartite states, systems utilizing multi-partite squeezing and entanglement may lead to an even further performance increase. We investigate this by analyzing the correlation coefficient for a tripartite system electric field measurement to determine how it compares to the bipartite systems in the current literature for the same transmit powers. This is done by defining a tripartite wave function in terms of the mean photon number per mode then determining the covariance matrix from this wave function. This work is important in understanding how alternative states of light can be used for quantum radar applications. © 2023, Electromagnetics Academy.

Ground life cycle testing (LCT) combined with an analysis on the electrical power system (EPS) battery is an empirical method used to demonstrate compliance to satellite service life requirements. The LCT compliance method adopted by the aerospace industry is based on demonstrating a space battery's life expectancy as a part of battery qualification. Real-time cell and lithium-ion battery (LIB) LCT data are commonly used for model inputs to EPS power and energy balance analyses, in LIB reliability analysis estimates, and to support on-orbit spacecraft mission life extension opportunities.

Here, these advantages are leveraged in a deeply depleted graphene-oxide-semiconductor (D 2 GOS) junction detector architecture to sense carriers created by ionizing radiation. Specifically, the room temperature response of a silicon-based D 2 GOS junction is analyzed during irradiation with 20 MeV S i 4 + ions. Detection was demonstrated for doses ranging from 12 to 1200 ions with device functionality maintained with no substantive degradation. To understand the device response, D 2 GOS pixels were characterized post-irradiation via a combination of electrical characterization, Raman spectroscopy, and photocurrent mapping. This combined characterization methodology underscores the lack of discernible damage caused by irradiation to the graphene while highlighting the nature of interactions between the incident ions and the silicon absorber. © 2022 Author(s).",,"Graphene; Ionizing radiation; Ions; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Semiconductor junctions; Densities of state; Device functionality; Device response; Energy; Graphene oxides; Oxide/semiconductor junctions; Postirradiation; Silicon-based; Temperature response; Two-dimensional; Irradiation",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA: DE-NA0003525; Sandia National Laboratories, SNL","The authors acknowledge the Center for Integrated Nanotechnology (CINT) for access to their atomic layer (ALD) deposition system and their electron beam evaporator, as well as Ava Howell for her help with the well-filling measurements.

Separators will melt, shrink, vaporize, and collapse under high temperatures, leading to internal short circuits and thermal runaway catastrophes of the cell. Therefore, the amelioration of battery safety challenges benefits from a fundamental understanding of separator behaviors under thermally abusive scenarios. This work investigates the role of separator thermal stability in modulating Li-ion cell safety performance. Three types of separators made of commercially available cellulose, trilayer polypropylene/ polyethylene/polypropylene, standard polypropylene, and an in-house modified graphene-polydopamine coated separator are fabricated in custom single layer pouch cells and subjected to accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests to investigate dynamic thermo-electrochemical interactions. The safety hazards of 18650 cylindrical cells assembled with different types of separators are predicted using a verified ARC computational model to compare the effects of separator heat resistance on cell-level thermal runaway risks. This study reveals the thermally robust mechanisms of diverse separator microstructures, indicating how the in-house modified graphene-polydopamine coated separator significantly enhances the safety limits of Li-ion batteries. © 2022 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”).

This work studies the fate of carriers from Au nanorods before and after the presence of reductively photodeposited Pd at the single-particle level using scattering and emission spectroscopy, along with ensemble photoelectrochemical methods. A sub-2 nm epitaxial Pd0shell was reductively grown onto colloidal Au nanorods via hot carriers generated from surface plasmon resonance excitation in the presence of [PdCl4]2-. These bimetallic Pd-Au nanorod architectures exhibited 14% quenched emission quantum yields and 9% augmented plasmon damping determined from their scattering spectra compared to the bare Au nanorods, consistent with injection/separation of intraband hot carriers into the Pd. Absorbed photon-to-current efficiency in photoelectrochemical ethanol oxidation was enhanced 50× from 0.00034% to 0.017% due to the photodeposited Pd. Photocurrent during ethanol oxidation improved 13× under solar-simulated AM1.5G and 40× for surface plasmon resonance-targeted irradiation conditions after photodepositing Pd, consistent with enhanced participation of intraband-excited sp-band holes and desorption of ethanol oxidation reaction intermediates owing to photothermal effects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this work, the hydrophilic-lipophilic difference (HLD) framework was used to predict the formation of spontaneous emulsions using a mixture of Span-80 and SLES surfactants. The spontaneity and emulsion behavior of different systems were modeled by estimating the HLDmix. The influence of surfactant ratio, salinity, and oil type was investigated. Spontaneous emulsification could only be observed when the HLDmixwas between -0.96 and 1.04. Within this range, a negative HLDmixresulted in a greater spontaneity to form o/w emulsion, and a w/o emulsion was more likely to form when the HLDmixwas positive. When the HLDmixwas close to 0 (between -0.22 and 0.56 in our systems), emulsions were formed in both the oil and aqueous phases with high spontaneity. A combined effect of ultralow interfacial tension, Span-80 micelle swelling, and interfacial turbulence due to Marangoni effects is likely the main mechanism of the spontaneous emulsification observed in this study. A synergistic reduction in interfacial tension was observed between Span-80 and SLES (&lt;1 mN/m). When the HLD of the system was close to 0, a bicontinuous emulsion phase was formed at the oil-water interface. The bicontinuous emulsion broke-up over time due to the ultralow interfacial tension and interfacial turbulence, forming dispersed oil and water droplets. Results from this work provide a practical method to suggest what surfactant composition, salinity, and oil type could promote (or eliminate) the conditions favorable for spontaneous emulsification. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Although advancements in LBAM processes and materials have led to increased manufacturing capabilities, the printing process's repeatability, durability, and reliability still face significant challenges. Therefore, a defect detection system for the LBAM processes is essential, as it promises to guarantee product quality and increase the efficiency of the printing process. As a practical and widely applied technology, machine learning methods have been providing novel insights into the manufacturing process, which has proven advantages for defect detection in LBAM. This paper summarizes the machine learning algorithms for defect detection in the metal LBAM processes.

In prior work, the CID- and vent-activation pressures were measured experimentally for two commercial lithium-ion battery caps (MTI 18650 and LG MJ1). The cap structure was then analyzed with high resolution CT scanning and finite element modeling (FEM) simulations were conducted to simulate the vent-activation pressure. In the present study, two additional vent cap assemblies from commercial lithium-ion cells (K2 18650E and LG M36) were analyzed. The experimentally measured CID-activation pressures of K2 and LG M36 caps were 0.997 ± 0.292 and 1.393 ± 0.113 MPa at ambient temperature and 0.834 ± 0.057 and 1.083 ± 0.077 MPa at 100 ℃. The experimentally measured vent-activation pressures of the K2 and LG M36 caps were 2.190 ± 0.372 and 2.363 ± 0.199 MPa at ambient temperature and 1.781 ± 0.355 and 1.799 ± 0.284 MPa at 100 ℃. In prior work, an FEM procedure was introduced to simulate the vent-activation pressure. In the present study, the vent-activation simulations were conducted on the new caps; additionally, the FEM procedure was extended to simulate CID-activation pressure and to conduct a sensitivity analysis on geometric parameters of the vent mechanism. At ambient temperature, the FEM simulated CID-activation pressure of the K2 and LG M36 caps were 1.207 and 1.428 MPa, respectively. The FEM simulated vent-activation pressure of the K2 and LG M36 caps at the ambient temperature were 2.241 and 2.379 MPa, respectively. Simulated CID- and vent-activation pressures for the K2 and LG M36 caps were in good agreement with experiments. The FEM procedure for simulating vent-activation pressure, and the newly-developed method for simulating CID-activation pressure, may be used in the future to design new vent cap assemblies and to develop temperature-dependent activation pressure functions for use in abuse simulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CID-activation; Lithium-ion battery; Safety; Thermal runaway; Vent-activation","Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Computerized tomography; Finite element method; Ions; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature; Vents; Activation pressure; CID-activation; Current interrupt; External circuits; Internal pressures; Lithium-ion cells; Modeling procedure; Thermal runaways; Vent caps; Vent-activation; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"Purdue University; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division under the Naval Innovative Science and Engineering Program.

Traditionally, network administrators utilize attack graphs to generate possible attack paths and estimate the attack probability (risk) in a networked environment. However, the attack probability does not alone provide enough directions to take security measures. Furthermore, there is a lack of combining the attack probability with the attack node's topological influence factors, which also contributes to propagate cyberattacks. This work proposes a cyber risk assessment platform to enhance cyber situational awareness by addressing those gaps. We first present methods to compute cyber risk using the attack graph and then extract network topological influence factors (i.e., features) using graph centrality measures. Next, we apply unsupervised learning to the extracted features to find the network's highly exploitable attack points. Finally, we use graph embedding techniques to identify the objective similarity among the attack privilege nodes. We illustrate the applications of our machine learning-based cyber risk assessment platform using a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) case study for the cyber-physical power systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the platform provides a better understanding of the cyber risk assessment and situational awareness by applying machine learning techniques on the attack graph. © 2022 IEEE.","attack graph; Cyber-physical systems; feature extraction; graph topology; machine learning; node embedding; risk assessment; unsupervised learning","Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Embeddings; Graph theory; Network security; Risk assessment; Risk perception; SCADA systems; Simulation platform; Unsupervised learning; Attack graph; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Embeddings; Features extraction; Graph topology; Machine-learning; Node embedding; Risks assessments; Situational awareness; Cyber Physical System",,,,,"W911NF-20-2-0277; Army Research Laboratory, ARL","This work was supported in part by the DoD Center of Excellence in AI and Machine Learning (CoE-AIML) under Contract Number W911NF-20-2-0277 with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.",,,,,,,,,,"Haque, M.A., Shetty, S., Kamhoua, C.A., Gold, K., Integrating mission-centric impact assessment to operational resiliency in cyber-physical systems (2020) GLOBECOM 2020-2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference, pp. 1-7. , ieee; Jha, S., Sheyner, O., Wing, J., Two formal analyses of attack graphs (2002) Proceedings 15th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop.

Betavoltaics operate similarly to photovoltaics where a radioisotope irradiates beta particles into a semiconductor p-n junction that converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy. Betavoltaics are limited by their power output from the radioiso-tope. The source density can be increased by the selection of solid-state substrates. While solid-state substrates can be selected from simulations, the viability of the substrate to absorb tritium has to evaluated. The development of a hydrogen loading system was performed to evaluate different film types to understand how they perform during the hydrogen/tritium loading process. The hydrogen loading system utilizes the Sievert method, where the initial pressure and volume is constant and pressure drop in the system is used to determine hydrogen uptake of a film substrate. The procedures of the hydrogen loading system are detailed. To test the procedures of the hydrogen loading system, old, palladium films were loaded. Results show uptake of hydrogen by the thin palladium films, as well as cycles of hydrogen absorption and desorption. Hydrogen loading of palladium was compared to a prior result and was shown to have similar results. © 2022 by ASME.",,"Hydrogen; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Palladium; Semiconductor junctions; Thin films; A: semiconductors; Beta particles; Energy devices; Hydrogen loadings; Loading system; Long lasting; Micropower; Palladium films; Photovoltaics; Thin-films; Substrates",,,,,"U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, USNRC; Purdue University, PU; Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA; Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University","The authors would like to thank NAVSEA Crane for equipment and funding support of the hydrogen loading system and palladium films.

This paper analyzes the various correlation coefficients for different types of quantum radar measurement schemes, such as: (i) immediate detection of the idler photon events to be used in post-processing correlation with the signal photon events, (ii) immediate detection of the idler electric field to be used in post-processing correlation with the signal electric field, (iii) immediate detection of the idler quadratures to be used in post-processing correlation with the signal quadratures, and (iv) conventional analog correlation method of the optical parametric amplifier. The showcased results compare the performance of these different methodologies for various environmental scenarios.

The safety performances of Li-ion batteries are dictated by the thermal stability of their component materials both individually and collectively due to intricate exothermic reactions. Although the heat release of individual battery material has been thoroughly investigated, the safety hazards of inter-electrode chemical crosstalk under thermal abuse scenarios remain elusive and thus need a fundamental understanding. This study carries out a comprehensive thermal analysis of various material samples harvested from a commercial Li-ion cell using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), complemented with full-cell accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) and computational modeling. Reaction kinetics of electrolyte, wet cathode, wet anode and DSC-full cell samples imitating cell layered architectures are delineated to reveal substantial thermal interactions between electrodes. High-resolution kinetic parameters of reaction mechanisms are estimated using a synergy of Kissinger's method and mechanism-driven non-linear optimization strategies. A thermal abuse model is built based on the extracted kinetic parameters to simulate the cell-level thermal runaway phenomenon and compared with experimental observations, indicating how interlayer crosstalk effects significantly impact the thermal safety characteristics of Li-ion cell chemistries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerating rate calorimetry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Lithium-ion battery; Modeling; Reaction kinetics; Safety; Thermal instability","Association reactions; Calorimeters; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Kinetic parameters; Lithium-ion batteries; Nonlinear programming; Reaction kinetics; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic stability; Accelerating rate calorimetry; Electrochemical systems; Heat release; High thermal; Kinetics parameter; Lithium-ion cells; Modeling; Thermal; Thermal instabilities; Thermal safety; Differential scanning calorimetry",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-18-1-2397; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Financial support in part from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) grant N00014-18-1-2397 is gratefully acknowledged.

This chemical engineering approach often focuses on maintaining performance effects upon replacement of objectionable ingredients, yet neglects the chemical products formed by the exothermic reaction. In this work, milligram quantities of a lab-scale pyrotechnic red smoke composition were functioned within a thermal probe for product identification by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thermally decomposed ingredients and new side product derivatives were identified at lower relative abundances to the intact organic dye (as the engineered sublimation product). Side products included chlorination of the organic dye donated by the chlorate oxidizer. Machine learning quantitative structure-activity relationship models computed impacts to health and environmental hazards. High to very high toxicities were predicted for inhalation, mutagenicity, developmental, and endocrine disruption for common military pyrotechnic dyes and their analogous chlorinated side products. These results underscore the need to revise objectives of “green” pyrotechnic engineering. © 2021","Environmental chemistry; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Pyrolysis; Pyrotechnic smokes and obscurants; Toxicity modeling","Gas chromatography; Health hazards; Ketones; Mass spectrometry; Pyrolysis; Smoke; Toxicity; Anthraquinone dye; Chemical products; Detection models; Environmental chemistry; Environmental pollutants; Organic dye; Performance effect; Pyrotechnic smoke and obscurant; Side products; Toxicity modeling; Environmental chemistry; anthraquinone; arsenic; benzene; bromine; carbon; chlorine; dye; fluorene; fluorine; hydrogen; iodine; mercury; naphthalene; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; silicon; sulfur; anthraquinone derivative; coloring agent; mutagenic agent; chemical reaction; chlorination; detection method; dye; pollutant removal; replacement; smoke; toxicity; acute toxicity; Article; chemical engineering; chemical reaction; chlorination; controlled study; developmental toxicity; ecotoxicity; environmental health; eye irritation; machine learning; mutagenicity; neurotoxicity; pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry; quantitative structure activity relation; reproductive toxicity; skin irritation; smoke; smoke pyrotechnic reaction; thermal analysis; toxicity testing; tobacco; Anthraquinones; Coloring Agents; Mutagens; Smoke; Tobacco",,"anthraquinone, 84-65-1; arsenic, 7440-38-2; benzene, 71-43-2; bromine, 7726-95-6; carbon, 7440-44-0; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; fluorene, 86-73-7; fluorine, 7782-41-4; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; iodine, 7553-56-2; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; naphthalene, 91-20-3; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; oxygen, 7782-44-7; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; silicon, 7440-21-3; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; Anthraquinones; Coloring Agents; Mutagens; Smoke",,,"NCRADANSWCCD-18-305","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding and support Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, Naval Innovative Science and Engineering (NISE) Program, and the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Ignites Program.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow through detailed geometric models of four vent-activated commercial 18650 lithium-ion cell caps were conducted using two turbulence modeling approaches: Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and scale-resolving simulations (SRS). The RANS method was compared with independent experiments of discharge coefficient through the cap across a range of pressure ratios and then used to investigate the ensemble-averaged flow field for the four caps. At high pressure ratios, choked flow occurs either at the current collector plate when flow through the current collector plate is more restrictive or the positive terminal vent holes when flow through the current collector plate is less restrictive. Turbulent mixing occurred within the vent cap assembly, in the jets emerging from the vent holes, and in recirculating zones directly above the vent cap assembly. The global maximum turbulent viscosity ratio ((Formula presented.)) of the MTI, LG MJ1, K2, and LG M36 caps at pressure ratio of P1/P2 = 7 were 4,575, 3,360, 3,855, and 2,993, respectively. SRS and RANS simulations showed that both velocity magnitude and fluctuating velocity magnitude were lower for vent holes which are obstructed by the burst disk. SRS showed high levels of fluctuating velocity in the jets, up to 48.5% of the global maximum velocity. The present CFD models and the resulting insights provide the groundwork for future studies to investigate how jet structure and turbulence levels influence combustion and heat transfer in propagating thermal runaway scenarios.

Herein, an effective method for LIB thermal runaway detection using a resistant temperature detector (RTD) is compared with a conventional battery surface temperature measurement. A direct electrode temperature measurement technique based on additive manufacturing-enabled application of miniature RTDs for measurement of internal temperature within large-capacity Li-ion pouch cells is used. The miniature RTDs are embedded in a customized electrochemically inactive polymeric substrate for real-time thermal safety monitoring during overcharge abuse. Electrode temperature profiles under different conditions of overcharge (at 1 and 5 C rate, charged until battery explosion) are analyzed and mechanisms of heat generation in LIBs during overcharge-induced thermal runaway are investigated. The internal RTDs detect the onset temperature of the solid−electrolyte interface decomposition ≈10 s earlier than the sensors attached to the battery surface. A maximum temperature gradient of ≈200 °C is observed between the electrode and the battery surface during overcharge-induced thermal runaway. The internal RTDs are shown as a possible guide for sensor placement location to capture the maximum temperature within the LIBs during abuse events. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","electrode temperatures; Li-ion batteries; overcharge; resistance temperature detectors; thermal runaway","Electrodes; Explosions; Ions; Polyelectrolytes; Solid electrolytes; Temperature measurement; Temperature measuring instruments; Battery failures; Cycling conditions; Electrode temperature; Operando; Overcharge; Real- time; Resistance temperature detectors; Safety monitoring; Thermal runaways; Thermal safety; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014‐18‐1‐2397; Purdue University","This work was supported by the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University, and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) (Program manager: Dr. Michele Anderson.

The central axis of the trap is kept free of obstructions to allow for site-resolved imaging of ions in the 2D crystal plane, and the confining potentials are provided by four segmented blade electrodes. We discuss the design challenges, fabrication techniques, and voltage requirements for implementing this open-endcap trap. Finally, we validate its operation by confining up to 29 ions in a 2D triangular lattice, oriented such that both in-plane principal axes of the 2D crystal lie in the radial direction. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crystals; Design challenges; Experimental demonstrations; Fabrication technique; Radial direction; Radiofrequency trap; Triangular lattice; Two Dimensional (2 D); Voltage requirement; Ions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blatt, R, Wineland, D, (2008) Nature, 453, p. 1008; Häffner, H, Roos, C F, Blatt, R, (2008) Phys.

Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self-assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two-dimensional molecular self-assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor-acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self-assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill-defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","hydrogen bonds; scanning probe microscopy; self-assembly; surface chemistry; tautomerism","Copper metallography; Gold metallography; Molecules; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Silver metallography; Stereochemistry; Assembled structures; Chemical compositions; Donor-acceptor pairs; Intermolecular interactions; Molecular dimensions; Molecular self assembly; Prototropic tautomerisms; Self-assembly patterns; Hydrogen bonds; chemical structure; hydrogen bond; scanning tunneling microscopy; Hydrogen Bonding; Microscopy, Scanning Tunneling; Molecular Structure",,,,,"2018H1A2A1060348, NCRADANSWCCD-18-280; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2017M3D1A1039558, 2020R1A2C2006381","This work was supported by Indiana University's Office of the Vice President for Research, College of Arts & Sciences, and Department of Chemistry (to S.L.T.), and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea (2020R1A2C2006381 and 2017M3D1A1039558 to D.L.).

In order to better understand the reactivity potential for the SSMCs it is necessary to study the ligand-metal interaction in the metal-organic coordination networks. In the work reported here, we demonstrate the ability to tune the oxidation state of vanadium from II to IV through the tailoring of redox-active ligands. Using the N-heterocyclic ligands of bipyrimidine (BP), bispyrimidinyltetrazine (BMTZ), and biimidazole (BIM) complexed with metallic V, we have shown that the oxidation state of the V metal centers can be tuned to V(II) for BP, V(III) for BMTZ, and V(IV) for BIM. These redox-active ligands provide similar coordination environments when complexed into one dimensional chains but result in different oxidation states for the single-site metal center. © 2021","Charge transfer; Density functional calculations; Metal-organic coordination; Metals; On-surface redox assembly; Redox-active ligands; Scanning tunneling microscopy; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Catalyst selectivity; Metals; Organometallics; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Area of interest; Coordination environment; Heterogeneous catalyst; Metal interactions; Metal organic coordination; One-dimensional chains; Organic ligands; Redox-active ligand; Ligands",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CHE-1610984, CHE-1955343","STM and XPS experiments were conducted at Indiana University (IU) and were supported by the National Science Foundation , CHE-1610984 .

By relying on pressure from restraint plates to make tab electrical connections, this method (1) requires no welding, (2) does not require a dry room, (3) does not require precision sealing equipment inside of an inert-gas glove box, and (4) does not require removal of composite material off of one side of the electrode which may compromise the composite to be tested on the other side. Lithium chips pressed onto copper mesh serve as the reference and counter electrodes and the electrolyte used was 1.0 M LiPF6 1:1 ethylene carbonate (EC):Diethyl carbonate (DEC) v/v. Electrochemical cycling of electrodes from a commercial 3.6 Ah 18650 lithium-ion cell demonstrated cell function and showed stable capacity and potential charge/discharge profiles after two cycles for the cathode and four cycles for the anode. The areal capacity of the anode and cathode was determined to be 5.50 ± 0.31 and 5.50 ± 0.30 mAh/cm2, respectively, based on a potential range of 0.005-1.5 V versus Li/Li+ for the anode and 3.0-4.25 V versus Li/Li+ for the cathode. High frequency, 500 kHz impedance measurements of the anode and cathode cells shows a real impedance of 1.55 Ohms and 2.17 Ohms, respectively, which is similar to prior studies on pouch cells with continuous tabs of similar capacity. © 2021 by ASME","advanced materials characterization; batteries; innovative material synthesis; manufacturing methods","Anodes; Cathodes; Electric connectors; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Ethylene; Fluorine compounds; Inert gases; Ions; Lithium compounds; Phosphorus compounds; Advanced material characterization; Advanced materials; Cell methods; Double sided; Innovative material synthesis; Innovative materials; Li +; Manufacturing methods; Materials characterization; Materials synthesis; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,,"The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division or the U.S. Government.",,,,,,,,,,"Ehrlich, G.

When supplied with a constant DC power source, the RFPA has very poor efficiency. Envelope tracking (ET) is a supply modulation technique where the supply voltage varies dynamically to track the envelope of the input radio frequency (RF) signal. A cascaded switching capacitor-based multi-phase three-level buck converter is proposed in this digest as a drain supply modulator. EPC 8000 family eGaN MOSFETS are used to enable the multi - MHz high switching frequency of operation of the converter. A fourth-order low pass LC-filter is designed to enable the zero-voltage switching and to track the 20 MHz 4G LTE band-limited envelope signal. The proposed converter has a peak efficiency of 97.3 % and over 95 % for most of the output voltage range. Simulation results and preliminary experimental results are provided to validate the proposed concept. © 2021 IEEE.","Current balancing; Drain supply modulator; Envelope tracking; Filter design; Multi-level; Multi-phase buck; Power amplifier; Switched capacitor; ZVS","5G mobile communication systems; Data transfer; DC-DC converters; Drain current; Efficiency; Radio frequency amplifiers; Radio transmission; Radio waves; Zero voltage switching; Current balancing; Drain supply modulator; Envelope tracking; Filter designs; Multi-phase buck; Multilevels; Supply modulator; Switched capacitor; Switching capacitors; Three-level; Power amplifiers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"McCune, E., Envelope tracking or polar-which is it?

Single FinFET and NW of similar total height are created using process simulation. Two types of NWs are studied, namely, high-performance and low-power NW, which has the same OFF-state and ON-state current as the FinFET, respectively. Device simulations are performed using transport parameters calibrated in Monte Carlo simulations. Radiation hardness of both n-type and p-type devices are simulated by striking particles at various locations and directions when the transistors are at OFF-state. It is found that NW is more robust than FinFET in all strike locations and directions. Radiation strikes are then applied to the OFF-state transistors in the SRAM at the most vulnerable positions. The SRAMs of both devices are designed to have similar noise margins for a fair comparison. It is found that NW SRAM is much more robust and can sustain two to three times higher linear energy transfer (LET) than FinFET SRAM in the most striking locations. Therefore, from a radiation robustness perspective, NW SRAM is preferred. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","FinFET; nanosheet; nanowire (NW); radiation hardness; simulation; static random-access memory (SRAM); technology computer-aided design (TCAD)","Electronic design automation; Energy transfer; FinFET; Hardness; Location; Monte Carlo methods; Nanowires; Device simulations; Linear energy transfer; On state current; Process simulations; Radiation hardness; Static random access memory; Technology computer aided design; Transport parameters; Static random access storage",,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD: N00164-19-1-1001","Manuscript received February 10, 2021; revised March 18, 2021; accepted March 18, 2021.

A series of alloy and core-shell Au-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared to synergistically couple plasmonic (Au) and catalytic (Pd) metals to tailor their optical and catalytic properties. Metal-based catalysts supporting a localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can enhance energyintensive chemical reactions via augmented carrier generation/separation and photothermal conversion. Titania-supported Au-Pd bimetallic (i) alloys and (ii) core-shell NPs initiated the ethanol (EtOH) oxidation reaction under solar-simulated irradiation, with emphasis toward driving carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage at low temperatures. Plasmon-assisted complete oxidation of EtOH to CO2, as well as intermediary acetaldehyde, was examined by monitoring the yield of gaseous products from suspended particle photocatalysis. Photocatalytic, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) results are correlated with Au-Pd composition and homogeneity to maintain SPRinduced charge separation and mitigate the carbon monoxide poisoning effects on Pd. Photogenerated holes drive the photo-oxidation of EtOH primarily on the Au-Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts and photothermal effects improve intermediate desorption from the catalyst surface, providing a method to selectively cleave C-C bonds. © 2021 by the authors.

This work demonstrates the ability to modulate light emission intensity of a pyrotechnic flame with 2.46 GHz microwave energy within a multimodal cavity. Stoichiometric mixtures of three pyrotechnic systems are investigated: magnesium fuel with oxidizers of NaNO3, KNO3, or CsNO3. Using time-resolved visible and infrared emission spectroscopy and high-speed color videography, microwave illumination of flames is found to produce enhanced atomic photo emission from the alkali species. Emission increases of up to ~120% are demonstrated, which are predominantly in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths and have little effect on flame emission chromaticity. At near- and mid-IR wavelengths, gray body continuum enhancement is observed with moderate enhanced emission from CO2 and H2O bands. Sustained light emission from microwave illumination of combustion products long after pyrotechnic extinguishment was also demonstrated. A simplified model of microwave-enhanced visible and near-IR emission is presented and shown to be consistent with the observed trend of elevated emission enhancement for lower wavelength alkali transitions. Sensitivity analysis is performed which suggests a lower equilibrium population of electronically excited alkali atoms is primarily responsible for maximizing the degree of light emission enhancement of applied microwave fields, especially in extinguished low-temperature pyrotechnic plumes. These findings suggest microwave illumination of alkali-containing pyrotechnic flames may be a useful strategy to achieve dynamic control of light emission intensity. © 2020","Alkali metal-doping; Energetic materials; Metal combustion; Plasma-assisted combustion; Pyrotechnics","Cesium compounds; Combustion; Emission control; Emission spectroscopy; Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Light emission; Light modulation; Potash; Potassium Nitrate; Sensitivity analysis; Sodium nitrate; Temperature; Video recording; Combustion products; Emission enhancement; Infrared emission spectroscopy; Light emission intensity; Microwave energies; Pyrotechnic systems; Stoichiometric mixtures; Visible and near infrared; Microwaves; alkali; alkali metal; carbon dioxide; cesium nitrate; fuel; magnesium; potassium nitrate; sodium nitrate; water; Article; colorimetry; combustion; electric field; flame; illumination; infrared radiation; infrared spectroscopy; light; light intensity; low temperature; luminance; microwave radiation; plume; priority journal; pyrotechnics; sensitivity analysis; stoichiometry",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; cesium nitrate, 7789-18-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; potassium nitrate, 7757-79-1; sodium nitrate, 7631-99-4; water, 7732-18-5",,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NNX16AL88H; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR: FA9550-15-1-0195, FA9550-17-1-0167; Iowa Space Grant Consortium, ISGC; Iowa State University, ISU; Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, SERDP: WP19-1163","The authors wish to acknowledge financial support from SERDP WP19-1163 under the direction of Dr. Robin Nissan, the NSWC-Crane Naval Innovative Science and Engineering Program , and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research ( FA9550-15-1-0195 and FA9550-17-1-0167 ) under the direction of Dr. Mitat Birkan.

This paper introduces and demonstrates a method of hardening microelectronic devices for sustained use in applications where exposure to ionizing radiation exists. By incorporating quantum structures below active regions of devices, gettering of charges created by ionizing radiation becomes possible. The gettering of electrons and holes forces recombination of carriers, thus eliminating photocurrent surges and trap filling which would otherwise disrupt device operation. Experimental results discussed here show a reduction in photocurrent of over two orders of magnitude when utilizing energy band engineering to create quantum structures for charge gettering. In this work, a nitride-based high electron mobility two-dimensional electron gas demonstrates the method. However, the theory utilized pertains not only to nitride-based devices, but transfers to other materials as well. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Band structure; Hardening; Ionizing radiation; Microelectronics; Nitrides; Photocurrents; Radiation hardening; Radiation shielding; Device operations; Electrons and holes; Energy band engineering; High electron mobility; Micro-electronic devices; Nitride-based devices; Orders of magnitude; Radiation environments; Two dimensional electron gas",,,,,"Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA: 19-CR-WD-0056, CRANBAA19-001, N00164-1-1011","The authors gratefully thank Dr. Maksym Zhukovskyi and Dr. Tatyana Orlov from the University of Notre Dame for TEM analysis, as well as NAVSEA Crane’s CRANBAA19-001 (Grant No. N00164-1-1011) and NISE (Award No. 19-CR-WD-0056) for financial support.",,,,,,,,,,"Messenger, G.C., Ash, M.S., (1986) The Effects of Radiation on Electronic Systems, , (Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.); Fan, W.C., Drumm, C.R., Roeske, S.B., Scrivner, G.J., Shielding considerations for satellite microelectronics (1996) IEEE Trans.

The LIBs are cycled until end of life (EOL) under various dynamic conditions, providing in-operando battery performance examination. A sensor network constructed consisting of a resistance temperature detector (RTD), an accelerometer, an eddy current sensor and a shunt resistor is incorporated into the setup. Mechanisms of LIB capacity fade, temperature rise, and deformation from cycling in representative dynamic environments are analyzed and compared with results from theoretical analyses as well as with electrode structure evaluation. The sensor network identifies critical periods with high heat generation and stress accumulation rates. By comparing single cell and battery pack performances, complex effects of examined boundary conditions on LIB heat generation are analyzed. Using the sensor network, an approach to identify critical cell(s) with the highest risk of safety hazards without the need for electrochemical modeling is presented. Raman spectroscopy analyses, SEM imaging, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses are also applied to support the observations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic load; Lithium-ion battery; Sensor network; Stress; Temperature; Thermal runaway","Battery management systems; Battery Pack; Dynamic analysis; Eddy current testing; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Heat generation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Sensor networks; Temperature measuring instruments; Vibration analysis; Battery performance; Dynamic environments; Eddy current sensors; Electrochemical modeling; Electrode structure; Performance degradation; Resistance temperature detectors; Stress accumulation; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-18-1-2397; Purdue University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, NUAA","The authors acknowledge the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University for their financial support in this project.

Their specific functionality is determined by programming the FPGA with a configuration file, or bitstream, which often occurs at bootup. FPGAs rely on a hardware Root-of-Trust (RoT) to verify the authenticity of these (re)programming attempts. Any vulnerability in an FPGA's RoT enables adversarial (re)programming, tampering, and information extraction from the FPGA. Unlike software, when hardware RoT vulnerabilities are exposed the FPGA cannot be patched, but remains forever vulnerable to exploit.This work assumes a hardware RoT on an FPGA will be compromised at some point by an adversary. We propose incorporating a second, patchable, layer of security to prevent adversarial attacks on FPGAs, even those with potentially compromised hardware RoT schemes. To accomplish this, we present Patchable Hardware Security Module (PHaSM), a patchable hybrid security framework that enables a secondary RoT. PHaSM implements a small bootloader in the FPGA's reconfigurable fabric and incorporates user-defined authentication and decryption schemes. The bootloader loads an application configuration, PHaSM then decrypts and authenticates it using the user-defined schemes, and programs the application design into the remaining FPGA fabric using partial reconfiguration. Should the user-defined security scheme become vulnerable, a new security scheme can be incorporated without modifying the original application design. © 2021 IEEE.","Bitstream; FPGA; Reconfiguration; Security","Application programs; Authentication; Binary sequences; Cryptography; Hardware security; Integrated circuit design; Reconfigurable hardware; Application design; Bitstreams; Boot loaders; Consumer applications; Hardware devices; Programmable hardware; Reconfiguration; Root of trusts; Security; Security scheme; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trimberger, S., Three ages of fpgas: A retrospective on the first thirty years of fpga technology (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 318-331; Ender, M., Moradi, A., Paar, C., The unpatchable silicon: A full break of the bitstream encryption of xilinx 7-series fpgas (2020) 29th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 20), , Boston, MA, USENIX Association, Aug; (2021) Using Encryption to Secure A 7 Series Fpga Bitstream, , https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/applicationnotes/xapp1239-fpga-bitstream-encryption.pdf; (2021) Using Encryption and Authentication to Secure An Ultrascale/ultrascale+ Fpga Bitstream, , https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/applicationnotes/xapp1267-encryp-efuse-program.pdf; (2021) Intel Stratix 10 Device Security User Guide, , https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/stratix-10/ug-s10-security.pdf; Moradi, A., Schneider, T., Improved side-channel analysis attacks on xilinx bitstream encryption of 5, 6, and 7 series (2016) Workshop on Constructive Side-Channel Analysis and Secure Design, , Springer; Swierczynski, P., Becker, G.T., Moradi, A., Paar, C., Bitstream fault injections (bifi)-automated fault attacks against sram-based fpgas (2018) IEEE Transactions on Computers, 67 (3), pp. 348-360; Skorobogatov, S., Woods, C., Breakthrough silicon scanning discovers backdoor in military chip (2015) International Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, 2012, pp. 23-40. , Springer; Moradi, A., Oswald, D., Paar, C., Swierczynski, P., Side-channel attacks on the bitstream encryption mechanism of altera stratix ii: Facilitating black-box analysis using software reverse-engineering (2013) Proceedings of the ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays, 2013, pp. 91-100; Moradi, A., Barenghi, A., Kasper, T., Paar, C., On the vulnerability of fpga bitstream encryption against power analysis attacks: Extracting keys from xilinx virtex-ii fpgas (2011) CCS, pp. 111-124; Moradi, A., Kasper, T., Paar, C., An analysis of the xilinx virtex-4 and virtex-5 bitstream encryption mechanism (2012) CT-RSA 2012, pp. 1-18. , Springer; Karam, R., Hoque, T., Ray, S., Tehranipoor, M., Bhunia, S., Power analysis attack on hardware implementation of mac-keccak on fpgas (2016) ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig), 2016 International Conference on, pp. 1-8; Chakraborty, R., Saha, I., Palchaudhuri, A., Kumar, G., Hardware trojan insertion by direct modification of fpga configuration bitstream (2013) Design & Test, 30, pp. 45-54; Lohrke, H., Tajik, S., Krachenfels, T., Boit, C., Seifert, J.-P., Key extraction using thermal laser stimulation: A case study on xilinx ultrascale fpgas (2018) IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, IACR; (2019) 100 Seconds of Solitude, , https://thrangrycat.com/, Red Balloon Security Incorporated; Swierczynski, P., Moradi, A., Oswald, D., Paar, C., (2015) Physical Security Evaluation of the Bitstream Encryption Mechanism of Altera Stratix Ii and Stratix Iii Fpgas, 7, pp. 1-21; Barenghi, A., Pelosi, G., Teglia, Y., Information leakage discovery techniques to enhance secure chip design (2011) Information Security Theory and Practice.

The activation pressure for these two mechanisms, and how it varies with temperature, is an important parameter for the thermal runaway models incorporating electrolyte evaporation, gas generation and venting. This paper presents a method to extract the geometry of four commercial 18650 lithium-ion vent cap assemblies and measure the CID- and vent-activation pressures with a customized experimental setup. The experimental data were collected at ambient temperature and 100 ℃. The CID-activation pressures of the MTI, LG MJ1, K2, and LG M36 caps were 1.058 ± 0.053, 1.293 ± 0.119, 0.997 ± 0.292 and 1.393 ± 0.113 MPa at ambient temperature and 0.920 ± 0.076, 1.066 ± 0.068, 0.834 ± 0.057 and 1.083 ± 0.077 MPa at 100°C, respectively. The vent-activation pressures of the MTI, LG MJ1, K2, and LG M36 caps were 2.308 ± 0.196, 2.202 ± 0.083, 2.190 ± 0.372 and 2.363 ± 0.199 MPa at ambient temperature and 1.919 ± 0.132, 1.866 ± 0.084, 1.781 ± 0.355 and 1.799 ± 0.284 MPa at 100°C, respectively. The experimental setup may be used in future studies to measure activation pressures of future cylindrical cells. The CAD model of the caps may be used to develop a finite element model (FEM) to simulate the CID- and vent-activation pressure and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to design more reliable and effective CID and vent mechanisms.

Two Single-Event Effects (SEE) in STT MRAM will be discussed, which are bit-flips due to magnetization reversal of the ferromagnetic layers [1] and a negative bit resistance shift caused by soft dielectric breakdown [2]. These SEE have a high Linear Energy Critical Threshold (LET > 53 MeV-cm 2/mg) and hence a low error rate probability in space. Due to the observation of Single Event Functional Interrupts (SEFIs) for other MRAM manufacturers, a simplified method of device irradiation while the device remains unbiased in ESD foam allows decoupling of the Front End of Line (FEOL) transistor circuits from the Back End of Line (BEOL) memory elements. This method allowed recognition of the SEE as a p-MTJ effect. Simulation of SEFIs [3] using a laser will be briefly discussed. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Magnetic recording; Magnetization reversal; MRAM devices; Radiation hardening; Bit resistance; Bit-flips; Ferromagnetic layers; Layer 1; Magnetization - reversal; Memory density; Radiation tolerances; Single event; Single event effects; STT-MRAM; Radiation effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kobayashi, D., 2017 Jpn.

While data compression techniques can significantly reduce the storage requirements and memory bandwidths for many types of data including image and audio files, a reasonable implementation for RF signals is less explored. However, since recorded RF signals can be extremely large, they often significantly impact the storage and handling of the data. In this paper, we focus on software defined radios (SDR) that process RF signals in the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) time samples, which are then transformed into a time-frequency representation. We investigate the use cases of the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, which reduces the dimension of the time-frequency representation of the IQ samples, forming a low-rank approximation of the original. We validate the proposed method in various lossy RF signal compression tasks that show fast and reliable compression results with acceptable reconstruction error. © 2021 European Signal Processing Conference.

To this end, we propose an efficient and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers to collect their own data to build a customized RF classification system. The GUI operates in the time-frequency (TF) domain, which is achieved by applying short-time Fourier transform to the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) time domain signals. Using the proposed GUI, a radio frequency (RF) dataset is collected from the ultra high frequency industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) transceivers, and COTS transceiver modules. We train three different variants of convolutional neural network models, such as VGG and ResNet, using the collected dataset and show that they can perform acceptable test-time classification (up to 95% accuracy) on unseen real-world RF signal recordings. Our experimental results also show that a carefully prepared TF domain without a loss of information can achieve better performance than a magnitude-only representation that loses phase information during the TF transformation. We open-source our project to provide the public with access to the labeled datasets, programming code, and the GUI software that can expedite the labeling process. © 2021 European Signal Processing Conference.

The model accounts for multi-mode heat transfer, physics associated with gas generation, evaporation of liquid electrolyte, and venting of gases out of the cell during thermal runaway. The model was exercised for two different cases of oven test and external heater. It was found that the role of evaporative cooling changes depending on the state of the decomposition reactions at the time of vent-activation. For oven tests with low temperature and for external heating at slow rates, the energy budget is delicately balanced between decomposition reactions and heat exchange with the surroundings. In these scenarios, the evaporative cooling has a significant effect, and the characteristic temperature decrease after venting is observed. Under faster heating scenarios, vent activation occurs at a time when the decomposition reactions are underway. The evaporative cooling effect is less significant in these scenarios, and the temperature vs. time signature does not show the characteristic temperature decrease. The model presented in this work provides a useful tool for parameter identification, sensitivity analysis, and probing the effects of gas generation, evaporation, and venting.

In this study, the transient flow boiling characteristics in two thermally isolated, hydrodynamically coupled parallel microchannels are investigated experimentally. High-speed flow visualization is synchronized to high-frequency heat flux, wall temperature, pressure drop, and mass flux measurements to provide time-resolved characterization. Two constant and two transient heating conditions are presented. For a constant heat flux of 63 kW/m2 into each channel, boiling occurs continuously in both channels and the parallel channel instability is observed to occur at 15 Hz. Time-periodic oscillations in the pressure drop and average mass flux are observed, but corresponding oscillations in the wall temperatures are virtually non-existent at this condition. At a slightly lower constant heat flux of 60 kW/m2, boiling remains continuous in one of the channels, but the other channel experiences time-periodic flow regime oscillations between single-phase and two-phase flow. At this condition, extreme time-periodic wall temperature oscillations are observed in both channels with a long period (&#x007E;7 s) due to oscillations in the severity of the flow maldistribution. For the transient heating conditions, square wave heating profiles oscillating between different heat flux levels are applied to the channels. Because of their relatively high frequency, the heating transients are attenuated by the microchannel walls, resulting in effectively constant heating conditions and flow boiling characteristics like that of the aforementioned constant heating conditions. This study illustrates the susceptibility of parallel two-phase heat sinks to flow maldistribution, particularly when undergoing transient flow regime oscillations.

However, there are significant challenges in guaranteeing the desired output quality due to uncertainties inherent to the printing process. These include uncertainties in the quality of raw materials across different batches, fabrication environment (e.g., humidity, temperature), and machine wearing. The widespread adoption of fused filament fabrication for industrial applications faces considerable challenges in reducing part-to-part variations and assuring the mechanical properties of a manufactured component. In this paper, an in situ fault detection platform that considers the structural properties of the printed part is proposed. The presented system uses the optical camera and a deep learning methodology to detect faults online using training sets developed offline. The performance of the system is quantified using a variety of metrics. Computational speed for inference computation, minimum fault-sized detection, and measurement noise in the system are examined in this work. © 2021 SPIE.","Additive manufacturing; Convolutional neural network; Fused filament fabrication; Online fault detection; Structural validation","3D printers; Deep learning; Fault detection; Learning systems; Materials handling; Nondestructive examination; Computational speed; Fabrication method; In-situ fault detection; Manufacturing capability; Measurement Noise; Optical camera; Output quality; Printing process; Fabrication",,,,,"30228; South Carolina Space Grant Consortium, SCSGC: 521179-RP-SC007","This material is based upon work supported by the South Carolina Research Authority under grant 30228 and the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium under grant 521179-RP-SC007.

This paper studies the performance of a quantum radar that uses a tripartite squeezed state, whereby two signal beams are sent out towards the target which both correlate with the idler. It is found that for very low signal strengths, the bipartite has better performance. As the signal strength increases however, the tripartite becomes dominant. This result suggests that quantum radar (declared useful only in the low SNR regime) may possess more possibilities of increased performance at higher SNRs when different states are used for correlation. The bottleneck, of course, is the ability to generate transmit powers necessary to utilize. © 2021 SPIE.","covariance; entanglement; quantum enhancement; Quantum Radar; tripartite","Radar; Radar equipment; Correlation performance; Low-snr regimes; Signal beams; Signal strengths; Squeezed state; Transmit power; Quantum theory",,,,,"N00174-19-1-0007; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","This work is a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State Applied Research Laboratory and the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) through NEEC Grant # N00174-19-1-0007 awarded by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.",,,,,,,,,,"Lanzagorta, M., (2012) Quantum Radar, , San Rafael, CA: Morgan and Claypool; Lanzagorta, M., Low-brightness quantum radar (2015) Radar Sensor Technology XIX; and Active and Passive Signatures VI, 9461, pp. 346-370. , G.

CPSs often incorporate approaches merging from different scientific fields such as embedded systems, control systems, operational technology, information technology systems (ITS), and cybernetics. Major cybersecurity concerns are rising around CPSs because of their expanding uses in the modern world today. Often the security concerns are limited to deriving risk analytics and security assessment. Others focus on the development of intrusion detection and prevention systems. To make the CPSs resilient, it needs a thorough understanding of the current cybersecurity frameworks proposed by different governing bodies in this domain. It is also imperative to realize how these frameworks are applying established security practices. To address the gap in understanding the defense-in-depth security architectures and achieving them within the CPS domain, we analyze the cybersecurity frameworks and the challenges in applying them. To give some background information, we start a discussion of the differences between ITS and CPS. We then present a state-of-the-art review of some of the existing cybersecurity frameworks for risk and resilience management. Finally, we propose formal techniques to realize the frameworks and security practices in the CPS domain by providing quantitative resilience analytics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytical hierarchy process; Criticality assessment; Cyber-Physical Systems; Cybersecurity frameworks; Graphical modeling; Resilience metrics; Security practices; TOPSIS",,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-OE0000780","Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-OE0000780.",,,,,,,,,,"Griffor, E.R., Greer, C., Wollman, D.A., Burns, M.J., (2017) Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems, 1. , : vol. , Overview, Technical report; Shi, L., Dai, Q., Ni, Y., Cyber-physical interactions in power systems: A review of models, methods, and applications (2018) Electr.

Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical phenomenon wherein adsorbed long-chain organic monolayers disrupt large-strain plastic deformation in metals. Using high-speed in situ imaging and post facto analysis, we show that the monolayers induce a ductile-to-brittle transition. Sinuous flow, characteristic of ductile metals, gives way to quasi-periodic fracture, typical of brittle materials, with 85% reduction in deformation forces. By independently varying surface energy and molecule chain length via molecular self-assembly, we argue that this ""embrittlement""is driven by adsorbate-induced surface stress, as against surface energy reduction. Our observations, backed by modeling and molecular simulations, could provide a basis for explaining diverse mechanochemical phenomena in solids. The results also have implications for manufacturing processes such as machining and comminution, and wear. © 2020 The Authors.",,"Embrittlement; Interfacial energy; Metals; Ductile to brittle transitions; Environment-assisted cracking; Liquid metal embrittlement; Manufacturing process; Mechanical behavior; Molecular self assembly; Molecular simulations; Molecule chain lengths; Monolayers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tabor, D., Babylonian lecanomancy: An ancient text on the spreading of oil on water (1980) J.

Generally, network administrators utilize attack graphs to estimate possible consequences in a networked environment. Attack graphs lack to incorporate the operations-specific dependencies. Localizing the dependencies among operational missions, tasks, and the hosting devices in a large-scale CPS is also challenging. In this work, we offer a graphical modeling technique to integrate the mission-centric impact assessment of cyberattacks by relating the effect to the operational resiliency by utilizing a combination of the logical attack graph and mission impact propagation graph. We propose formal techniques to compute cyberattacks' impact on the operational mission and offer an optimization process to minimize the same, having budgetary restrictions. We also relate the effect to the system functional operability. We illustrate our modeling techniques using a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) case study for the cyber-physical power systems. We believe our proposed method would help evaluate and minimize the impact of cyber attacks on CPS's operational missions and, thus, enhance cyber resiliency. © 2020 IEEE.","Cyber-physical systems; cyberattack; logical attack graph; mission impact; mission impact propagation graph; operability; optimization; resilience","Budget control; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Network security; Risk assessment; SCADA systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Impact assessments; Integrating systems; Inter-dependencies; Network administrator; Networked environments; Operational mission; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Computer crime",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-OE0000780","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-OE0000780.",,,,,,,,,,"Council, N.R., (2012) Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative; Phillips, C., Swiler, L.P., A graph-based system for networkvulnerability analysis (1998) Proceedings of the 1998 Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 71-79; Ibrahim, M., Alsheikh, A., Determining resiliency using attack graphs (2020) Recent Developments on Industrial Control Systems Resilience, pp. 117-133. , Springer; Sun, X., Liu, P., Singhal, A., Toward cyberresiliency in the context of cloud computing [resilient security] (2018) IEEE Security & Privacy, 16 (6), pp. 71-75; Cao, C., Yuan, L.-P., Singhal, A., Liu, P., Sun, X., Zhu, S., Assessing attack impact on business processes by interconnecting attack graphs and entity dependency graphs (2018) IFIP Annual Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy, pp. 330-348. , Springer; Jakobson, G., Mission-centricity in cyber security: Architecting cyber attack resilient missions (2013) 2013 5th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CYCon 2013), pp. 1-18; Albanese, M., Jajodia, S., A graphical model to assess the impact of multi-step attacks (2018) The Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation, 15 (1), pp. 79-93; Haque, M.A., Shetty, S., Krishnappa, B., Modeling cyber resilience for energy delivery systems using critical system functionality (2019) 2019 Resilience Week (RWS), 1, pp. 33-41; Haque, M.A., Shetty, S., Krishnappa, B., Cyber-physical system resilience: Frameworks, metrics, complexities, challenges, and future directions (2019) Complexity Challenges in Cyber Physical Systems: Using Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to Support Intelligence, Adaptation and Autonomy, pp. 301-337; Ou, X., Govindavajhala, S., Appel, A.W., Mulval: A logic-based network security analyzer (2005) USENIX Security Symposium, 8, pp. 113-128. , Baltimore, MD; Gonda, T., Pascal, T., Puzis, R., Shani, G., Shapira, B., Analysis of attack graph representations for ranking vulnerability fixes (2018) GCAI, pp. 215-228; Rao, B., Mitra, A., An approach to merging of two community subgraphs to form a community graph using graph mining techniques (2014) 2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, pp. 1-7; Garvey, P.R., Pinto, C.A., Introduction to functional dependency network analysis (2009) The MITRE Corporation and Old Dominion, Second International Symposium on Engineering Systems, 5. , MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Guariniello, C., DeLaurentis, D., Supporting design via the system operational dependency analysis methodology (2017) Research in Engineering Design, 28 (1), pp. 53-69; Lewis, T.G., (2011) Network Science: Theory and Applications, , John Wiley & Sons; Stouffer, K., Falco, J., (2009) Recommended Practise: Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-depth Strategies, p. 3. , Department of Homeland Security, Control systems security program, national cyber security division",,,"6G Office;Chunghwa Telecom;et al.;Foxconn;Huawei;Mediatek","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2020","7 December 2020 through 11 December 2020",,166751,,9781728182988,,,"English","IEEE Glob.

Geometry analysis, CID- and vent-activation pressure measurement, and finite element analysis mechanical simulation of the vent mechanism were performed for MTI and LG MJ1 18650 caps. The MTI cap used a spot-weld and the LG MJ1 cap used a notch-groove connection for the CID. The vent-activation mechanism was a notch-grooved disk for both caps. The CID-activation pressures were 1.058 ± 0.053 and 1.293 ± 0.119 MPa at ambient temperature and 0.920 ± 0.076 and 1.066 ± 0.068 MPa at 100°C for the MTI and LG MJ1 caps, respectively.

Mechanical simulations predicted vent-activation pressures in agreement with experiments and showed decrease maximum stress sensitivity to applied pressure near the vent-activation pressure, consistent with observed sample-to-sample vent-activation pressure variation. Mechanical simulation also predicted vent-activation pressures of 0.448 and 0.400 MPa for the MTI and LG MJ1 caps, respectively, at 300°C. © 2020","CID-activation; Lithium-ion battery; safety; thermal runaway; vent-activation","Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Sensitivity analysis; Spot welding; Temperature; Vents; Activation mechanisms; Activation pressure; Applied pressure; Current interrupt; Geometry analysis; Lithium-ion cells; Mechanical simulations; Pressure increase; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"Purdue University; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division under the Naval Innovative Science and Engineering Program.

Often referred to as being ‘gummy,’ cutting of tantalum is characterized by very thick chips, large cutting forces, and a poor surface finish on the machined surface. These unfavorable attributes of the cutting have usually been attributed to bcc tantalum's high strain-hardening capacity, relative softness, and low thermal conductivity; and a small shear plane angle. Here, we show using in situ high-speed imaging at low speeds, and ex situ chip morphology observations at higher commercial cutting speeds (625 mm/s), that the gummy nature of Ta in cutting, including the large forces and thick chips, is actually due to the prevalence of a highly unsteady plastic flow – sinuous flow – characterized by large-amplitude folding and extensive redundant deformation. The sinuous flow and the associated folding are much more amplified and extreme in tantalum (chip thickness ratio, 30–50), and with different morphology, than that observed in fcc Cu and Al (chip thickness ratio, 10–20), wherein this flow mode was first uncovered. The in situ observations are reinforced by force measurements, and chip morphology and cut-surface characterization. The observations also suggest that the sinuous flow, in the same genre of unsteady mesoscale flow modes such as shear banding and segmented flow, is quite prevalent in cutting of highly strain-hardening metal alloys. By application of a surface-adsorbing (SA) medium, e.g., permanent marker ink, to the initial workpiece surface, we show that sinuous flow can be disrupted and replaced by a more energetically favorable flow mode – segmented flow – with thin chips and >70% reduction in the cutting force. This flow disruption is mediated by a local ductile-to-brittle transition in the deformation zone, due to the action of the SA medium – a mechanochemical (MC) effect in large-strain deformation of metals. Equally importantly, the MC effect and underlying segmented flow are beneficial also for machined surface quality – producing nearly an order of magnitude improvement in the surface finish, creating a surface with minimal residual plastic strain, and reducing level of material pull-out. Thus, by use of the SA medium and triggering the MC effect, a promising new opportunity is demonstrated for improving the machinability of Ta by ameliorating its gumminess. The results could enhance the viability of Ta for applications such as gun barrel liners – applications for which it has been hitherto considered but discarded due to its poor machining characteristics. © 2020","Forces; Large-strain deformation; Mechanochemical effect; Quality; Refractory metal; Sinuous flow","Deformation; Finishing; Metal cutting; Morphology; Strain hardening; Surface properties; Tantalum; Ductile to brittle transitions; In-situ observations; Large strain deformation; Low thermal conductivity; Machined surface quality; Machining characteristics; Redundant deformations; Surface characterization; Shear flow",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CMMI 1562470, DMR 1610094; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD","JMD would like to acknowledge support from the DoD , Naval Surface Warfare Center , Crane Division , under the NISE Program and the DoD SMART Scholarship-for-Service Program.

It has been known for over 50 years that fault compaction or dilatancy may cause significant weakening or strengthening by dramatically changing the fluid pressure trapped in faults. Despite this fundamental importance, we have no real understanding of the exact conditions that lead to compaction or dilation during nucleation or rupture. To date, no direct measurements of pore pressure changes during slip in hydraulically isolated faults have been reported. We show direct examples of fluid pressure variations during nucleation and rupture using a miniature pressure transducer embedded in an experimental fault. We demonstrate that fluids not only are significant in controlling fault behavior but can provide the dominant mechanism controlling fault stability. The effect of fluid pressure changes can exceed frictional variations predicted by rate- and state-dependent friction laws, exerting fundamental controls on earthquake rupture initiation. ©2020.

For lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), numerous safety incidences have been roadblocks on the path toward realizing high-energy-density next-generation batteries. Solutions, viz. electrolyte additives, shut-off separators, and exotic coatings, have limited scope in their operating voltage window, response time, and performance. Various temperature monitoring devices have been tested out with their limitations. Here, we report in situ sensing of thermal signatures from the anode of a typical LIB using an internal resistance temperature detector (RTD). Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) comprised of ROCO2Li, (CH2OCO2Li)2 and ROLi is formed on the surface of a graphite anode, and its decomposition releases enormous heat during thermal runway events. Sensing the temperature from the anode gives direct access to the heat liberated in thermal runaway, including SEI decomposition related heat generation. External short circuit (ESC) and overcharge tests were conducted to trigger the thermal runaway event, and temperature of 36.4 and 48.4 °C were recorded using internal RTDs, which were 9 and 20 °C higher than with external RTD, respectively. Interestingly, internal RTD has detection ability for 90% temperature rise 14 times faster than compared to the external RTD. Modeling of simulated tests explained the occurrence of different regimes during thermal runaway events initialed by ESC and overcharge. Furthermore, multimode calorimetry (MMC) for LIB with internal RTD yielded more endothermic peaks beyond 150 °C due to the presence of three-dimensional (3D)-printed polylactic acid (PLA) support. Overall 1.75 kJ g-1 of generated heat was measured using MMC, which is significantly lower than LIB without an RTD sensor. The RTD-embedded assembly acts as a passive safety device while stationed inside the battery. Using thermal signatures from RTD, an advanced battery management system can lead to a conducive LIB, which would be a safer powerhouse for high-energy-density applications such as in the automotive industry and high-energy grid storage.

Here, the plasma and laser treatments result in an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. The oxygen plasma creates a slight decoupling of the layers and converts some of the MoS2 to MoO3. Subsequent laser irradiation further oxidizes the MoS2 to MoO3, as confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and results in localized regions of brightly luminescent MoS2 monolayer triangular islands as seen in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. The PL lifetimes are found to decrease from 494 to 190 ps after plasma and laser treatment, reflecting the smaller size of the MoS2 grains/regions. Atomic force microscopic imaging shows a 2 nm increase in thickness of the laser-irradiated regions, which provides further evidence of the MoS2 being converted to MoO3.

The model simulates heat and gas generation during external heating of an electrically isolated cell that results in thermal runaway. Gas generation within the cell leads to pressure build up until the point at which the vent mechanism opens and relieves the internal pressure. Compressible flow of gases is modeled through the vent cap as a function of pressure ratio across the vent. The energy balance of the battery cell includes: heat generated from decomposition reactions and electrical short, external heat transfer to the surroundings, heat absorbed with vaporization and melting processes, as well as the energy loss as material is vented from the cell. The model was able to capture features of the temperature evolution of the battery cell well and generate detailed information about the progression of thermal runaway. The model was exercised to simulate time-to-venting and time-to-thermal-runaway for various changes in cell design parameters such as: amount of free liquid electrolyte, external convection coefficient, and electrolyte evaporation rate after vent opening. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Gas generation; Li-ion battery; Safety; Thermal runaway; Venting","Compressibility of gases; Electrolytes; Energy dissipation; Gas generators; Heat transfer; Vents; Decomposition reaction; Evaporation rate; External convection; External heat transfer; Function of pressure; Liquid electrolytes; Pressure build up; Temperature evolution; Lithium-ion batteries; design method; electrolyte; energy balance; energy storage; gas production; heat transfer; heating; melting; venting",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Naval Surface Warfare Center , Crane Division under the Naval Innovative Science and Engineering Program.

This structure allows for post-fabrication tuning of the detector spectral response through voltage-induced modification of the carrier density within graphene and, therefore, its plasmonic response. These changes modify the transmittance through the metasurface, which is fabricated monolithically atop the detector, allowing for spectral control of light reaching the detector. Importantly, this structure provides a fabrication-controlled alignment of the metasurface filter to the detector pixel and is entirely solid-state. Using single pixel devices, relative changes in the spectral response exceeding 8% have been realized. These proof-of-concept devices present a path toward solid-state hyperspectral imaging with independent pixel-to-pixel spectral control through a voltage-actuated dynamic response. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Fabrication; Graphene; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared radiation; Pixels; Spectroscopy; Direct integration; Fabrication and characterizations; Metasurface; ON dynamics; Plasmonic response; Post-fabrication; Spectral control; Spectral response; Tunables; Type II; Infrared detectors",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA: DE-NA0003525; Sandia National Laboratories, SNL","This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at Sandia National Laboratories and was performed, in part, at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, a U.S. DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences user facility.

With the advent of high-power tunable circuitry, possibilities exist for real-time reconfiguration of the power amplifier fundamental and harmonic impedances to maximize output power and efficiency over changes in frequency and array scan angle. We present, for the first time, a search algorithm that performs simultaneous, fast tuning of the power amplifier fundamental- and harmonic-frequency load impedances. Simulation results demonstrate a 20% PAE increase for the transistor model examined over fundamental tuning alone. In addition, re-tuning after changing frequencies from 500 MHz to 300 MHz is shown to provide a 30% PAE improvement at the second frequency compared to using the same reflection coefficient as the first frequency. These improvements demonstrate the need and benefits of a fundamental and harmonic frequency reconfigurable radar transmitter amplifier in increasing the efficiency and radar range of the transmitter. © 2020 IEEE","Harmonic tuning; Power amplifier; Radar; Search algorithm; Transistor","Efficiency; Harmonic analysis; Power amplifiers; Radar; Radar transmitters; Transmitters; Tuning; Harmonic frequency; Harmonic impedances; Impedance tuning; Output power and efficiencies; Power efficiency; Search Algorithms; Strategic choice; Transistor model; High frequency amplifiers",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC: N00164-19-1-1002","This work was funded by the Naval Surface Warfare Center – Crane Division under Grant No. N00164-19-1-1002.

A rapid (&lt;5 min) decrease in the anode potential was observed after the anode reached 3.3-3.4 V vs Li/Li+ for about 6 h during the overdischarge. Non-uniform depositions of fluorine, oxygen, phosphorous, lithium and copper were observed on the surface of the anode from the overdischarged cells by SEM/EDS and XPS. Three-electrode measurements show lithium inventory in the cell increased after overdischarge, increasing cell discharge capacity. Tests on additional LiFePO4/graphite cells show that 1) the rapid anode potential decrease doesn't occur if the anode potential doesn't increase to &gt;1.8 V vs Li/Li+ during overdischarge, although oxygen deposition on the anode does occur, 2) fluorine, oxygen and phosphorous increases on the anode surface are not observed when the fixed resistive load is removed before the rapid anode potential decrease and 3) fluorine, copper and oxygen deposition occur without cell recharge. Collectively, results indicate the rapid anode potential decrease is an oxidative breakdown of the electrolyte on the surface of the anode that is initiated by copper oxidation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Traditional power systems are highly complex and heterogeneous. These systems focus on reliability, availability, and continuous performance and, thus, not designed to handle security issues. Network administrators often utilize attack graphs to analyze security in EDS. Although attack graphs are useful tools to generate attack paths and estimate possible consequences in a networked system, they lack incorporating the operational or functional dependencies. Localizing the dependencies among operational missions, tasks, and the hosting devices in a large-scale cyber-physical network is also challenging. Current research works handle the system dependency and the attack scenario modeling separately using dependency graphs and attack graphs, respectively. To address the gap of incorporating the mission operational dependencies with possible attack scenarios, in this work, we offer an approach to assess the cyberattack impact on the operational mission of the EDS by combining the logical attack graph and mission functional dependency graph. We provide the graphical modeling details and illustrate the approach using a case study of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) operations within an EDS environment. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","Attack graph; Energy delivery systems; Impact assessment; Impact propagation graph; Mission dependency; Operability","Data acquisition; Graphic methods; Privacy by design; Dependency graphs; Functional dependency; Functional dependency graphs; Network administrator; Operational mission; Supervisory control and data acquisition; System dependencies; Traditional power system; Network security",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-OE0000780","Acknowledgment.

We also derive the corresponding covariance matrix for a classical matched filtering remote sensing system and compare to the quantum result. We use this comparison to derive an expression for the quantum enhancement factor as a function of the mean photon number per mode, NsThis result is significant because it allows one to exactly calculate the predicted quantum enhancement as a function of transmit power, rather than only having an upper bound. Additionally, we look into previous analog correlation techniques using an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and show that immediately detecting the idler produces the same cross correlation terms. However, the actual measurements needed to harness these correlations is enhanced when one immediately detects the idler because it minimizes the added noise caused by the additional length of the idler path in the conventional method. Finally, our results also show that one does not need to count photons to harness these correlations, but rather, perform electric field measurements. © 2020 SPIE","Beamsplitter; Coherent state; Covariance; Quantum enhancement; Quantum Radar; SPDC","Covariance matrix; Electric fields; Optical correlation; Parametric amplifiers; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Radar; Radar equipment; Remote sensing; Actual measurements; Classical matched filtering; Conventional methods; Correlation techniques; Cross correlations; Enhancement factor; Optical parametric amplifiers (OPA); Remote sensing system; Optical parametric amplifiers",,,,,"N00174-19-1-0007; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","This work is a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State Applied Research Laboratory and the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) through NEEC Grant # N00174-19-1-0007 awarded by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.",,,,,,,,,,"Lanzagorta, M., (2011) Quantum Radar, , San Rafael: Morgan and Claypool Publishers; Lanzagorta, M., Low-brightness quantum radar (2015) Proc.

Many papers on this topic have compared the performance of a classical system versus a quantum system. However, the concept of a system using both classical and quantum components in conjunction has not been explored thoroughly. This paper documents the design and simulation of a quantum+classical cooperative remote sensing design in the optical regime. The arrangement uses quantum correlations created by entangled photons in addition to conventional classical waveform correlations. We show that the composite quantum+classical system exhibits increased performance compared to a pure classical system alone. © 2020 SPIE","Composite design; Entangled photons; Free space; Optical regime; Quantum correlations; Quantum radar; Remote sensing","Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Radar; Radar equipment; Classical systems; Communication community; Design and simulation; Entangled photons; Paper documents; Quantum correlations; Quantum system; Wave forms; Remote sensing",,,,,"N00174-19-1-0007; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","This work is a collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State Applied Research Laboratory and the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) through NEEC Grant # N00174-19-1-0007 awarded by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.",,,,,,,,,,"Lanzagorta, M., (2011) Quantum Radar, , San Rafael: Morgan and Claypool Publishers; Luong, D., Chang, C.W.S., Vadiraj, A.M., Damini, A., Wilson, C.M., Balaji, B., (2019) Receiver Operating Characteristics for a Prototype Quantum Two-Mode Squeezing Radar, , arXiv preprint; Chang, C.W.S., Vadiraj, A.M., Bourassa, J., Balaji, B., Wilson, C.M., Quantum-enhanced noise radar (2019) Applied Physics Letters, 114, p. 112601; Lanzagorta, M., Low-brightness quantum radar (2015) Proc.

Here, we present a customized LIB setup developed for early detection of electrode temperature rise during simulated thermal runaway tests incorporating a modern additive manufacturing-supported resistance temperature detector (RTD). An advanced RTD is embedded in a 3D printed polymeric substrate and placed behind the electrode current collector of CR2032 coin cells that can sustain harsh electrochemical operational environments (acidic electrolyte without Redox, short-circuiting, leakage etc.) without participating in electrochemical reactions. The internal RTD measured an average 5.8 °C higher temperature inside the cells than the external RTD with almost 10 times faster detection ability, prohibiting thermal runaway events without interfering in the LIBs’ operation. A temperature prediction model is developed to forecast battery surface temperature rise stemming from measured internal and external RTD temperature signatures. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-16-1-3109, N00014-18-1-2397",,,,,,,,,,,"Lee, J., Unlocking the potential of cation-disordered oxides for rechargeable lithium batteries (2014) Science, 343, pp. 519-522. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhtlajurk%3D;

The GPS signal was exploited for use in a multistatic passive coherent location (PCL) system. The GPS signal is especially attractive for PCL applications because of the native capability to produce position and velocity estimation. This paper examines the signal specifications for PCL implementation and explores the potential limitations of the proposed solutions. GPS specific methods are developed for multistatic PCL velocity estimation in a three-dimensional plane. The method developed is combined with previously completed work of GPS PCL position estimation for a complete system design in range and Doppler. The PCL system is evaluated against conventional GPS position estimation and velocity estimation and proves to have comparable metrics of performance. Analysis and simulation are performed for verification and validation of the developed methods. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Bistatic doppler; global positioning system (GPS) PCL; multistatic PCL; PCL Doppler estimation","Doppler effect; Analysis and simulation; Doppler; Doppler estimations; Multi-static; Passive coherent locations; Position and velocity estimation; Signals of opportunities; Verification-and-validation; Global positioning system",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","The work of S.

Losses for rib waveguiding structures fabricated using SE0100C core and NOA73 cladding layers are reported. The waveguide loss was measured at 4.2 dB/cm, which is high compared to losses for different electro-optic rib waveguides reported at 1.2-2.9 dB/cm. The refractive index of unpoled SEO100C was measured at 1.655, expanding on the manufacturer’s reported optical constants of 1.65 (TE) and 1.7 (TM) for poled SEO100C.

Because of an inherent gain mechanism proportional to graphene's high mobility (μ), this detector architecture exhibits large responsivities and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The ultimate sensitivity of the D2GOS junction detector may be limited, however, because of the generation of dark charge originating from interface states at the semiconductor/dielectric junction. Here, we examine the performance limitations caused by dark charge and demonstrate its mitigation via the creation of low interface defect junctions enabled by surface passivation. The resulting devices exhibit responsivities exceeding 10 000 A/W - a value which is 10× greater than that of analogous devices without the passivating thermal oxide. With cooling of the detector, the responsivity further increases to over 25 000 A/W, underscoring the impact of surface generation on performance and thus the necessity of minimizing interfacial defects for this class of photodetector. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","2D detector; 2D materials; GOS junction; graphene; high responsivity; interface defects; photodetector","Graphene; Interface states; Oxide semiconductors; Passivation; Photodetectors; Photons; Signal to noise ratio; 2D detector; GOS junction; Interface defects; Performance limitations; Photogenerated charge; Responsivity; Surface generations; Surface passivation; Semiconductor junctions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, X., Zhu, Y., Cai, W., Borysiak, M., Han, B., Chen, D., Piner, R.D., Ruoff, R.S., Transfer of Large-Area Graphene Films for High-Performance Transparent Conductive Electrodes (2009) Nano Lett., 9, pp. 4359-4363; Blake, P., Hill, E., Castro Neto, A., Novoselov, K., Jiang, D., Yang, R., Booth, T., Geim, A., Making Graphene Visible (2007) Appl.

These molecular self-assemblies have potential applications in organic electronics, catalysis, photovoltaics, and many other technologies. Understanding the intermolecular interactions on a surface can help predict packing, stacking, and charge transport properties of films and allow for new molecular designs to be tailored for a required function. We have previously studied a molecular platform, tris(N-phenyltriazole) (TPT), that exhibits planar stacking through >20 molecular layers through donor-acceptor-type intermolecular π-πcontacts between the electron-deficient tris(triazole) core and electron-rich peripheral phenyl units. Here, we investigate an expanded family of TPT-based molecules with variations made on the peripheral aryl groups to modulate the molecular electron distribution and examine the impact on molecular packing and charge transport properties. Molecular-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy was used to compare the molecular packing in the monolayer and to investigate the effects that the structural and electronic modifications have on the stacking in subsequent layers. Conductivity measurements were made using the four-point probe van der Pauw technique to demonstrate charge transport properties comparable to pentacene. Although molecular packing is clearly impacted by the chemical structure, we find that the charge transport efficiency is quite tolerant to small structural variations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carrier transport; Molecules; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Self assembly; Transport properties; Conductivity measurements; Electronic modifications; Intermolecular interactions; Molecular resolution; Molecular self assembly; Structural variations; Surface self-assembly; Van der Pauw technique; Morphology",,,,,"2017M3D1A1039558, 2017R1A2B2006605, DMR 1533988; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC; National Research Foundation, NRF; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work at Indiana University was supported by the NSF DMREF program, award number DMR 1533988.

Recent attacks to extract bitstream encryption keys, and research in automated bitstream manipulation tools, have created a class of vulnerabilities involving post-synthesis low-level FPGA editing. Current authentication and tamper (e.g., malicious modification) detection approaches dependent upon hash-based comparison mechanisms and register transfer level safeguards are vulnerable to these post-synthesis exploits. In this paper, we propose FLATS, which provides filling logic and testing spatially to combat such vulnerability. FLATS fills unused lookup tables (LUTs) within the FPGA design and inserts infrared-emitting spatial watermarks into the partially used LUTs at the post-synthesis stage for physical authentication and tamper detection using backside infrared imaging. FLATS takes an existing synthesized design and re-purposes a portion of its LUT initialization to function as a watermark allowing for the detection of changes to the post-synthesis placement and initialization.

To expand these structural libraries, molecules with larger functional groups are used on surfaces; these applications require the system to go to higher temperatures, necessitating studies of the reactivity and reaction pathways for alkyl type groups. We have designed and synthesized a prototypical molecule, 1,3,5-tris-(3,5-diethylphenyl)benzene (TDEPB), to examine reactivity on Cu(100) and Au(111) surfaces using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We report the dehydrogenation of ethyl groups in TDEPB at 450 K on Cu(100) and at 500 K on Au(111). For a structurally similar triphenylbenzene (TPB) molecule without the ethyl groups, dehydrogenation was only observed on the Cu(100) surface at 450 K. Desorption of TPB was observed from Au(111) at 500 K. For Au(111), it was thus the presence and reactivity of the ethyl groups that prevented complete desorption of the molecule. The reaction pathway for the ethyl groups was found to be different on Au(111) vs Cu(100), as two distinct steps were observed on Au(111). First, a dehydrogenation occurred at 500 K, followed by a structural change of the adsorbate at 550 K. The post-dehydrogenation structures on the two surfaces differ in the loss of the 750 cm −1 HREELS feature on the Au(111) while not on Cu(100) and in other spectral changes for TDEPB on Cu(100) at 650 K that were not observed for TDEPB on Au(111) or for TPB on either surface. These results demonstrate reaction pathways that may be encountered with alkyl-functionalized molecular building blocks on surfaces at elevated temperatures. © 2019","Alkane dehydrogenation; C-C bond formation; Catalysis; High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy; Scanning tunneling microscopy; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Benzene refining; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Dissociation; Electron emission; Electron energy levels; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Molecules; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Sheet metal; Synthesis (chemical); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alkane dehydrogenations; C-C bond formation; Elevated temperature; High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy; Hydrocarbon reactivity; Molecular building blocks; Reaction pathways; Surface nanostructure; Electron energy loss spectroscopy",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1665433; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES: DE-SC0016367","Surface analysis experiments at Indiana University were supported by the U.

Two key design considerations are the electron storage capacity of the ligand and the metal-coordinating pockets on the ligand. In an effort to move toward greater complexity in the systems, particularly dinuclear metal centers, we designed and synthesized tetraethyltetra-aza-anthraquinone, TAAQ, which has superior electron storage capabilities and four ligating pockets in a diverging geometry. Cyclic voltammetry studies of the free ligand demonstrate its ability to undergo up to a four-electron reduction. Solution-based studies with an analogous ligand, diethyldi-aza-anthraquinone, demonstrate these redox capabilities in a molecular environment. Surface studies conducted on the Au(111) surface demonstrate TAAQ′s ability to complex with Fe. This complexation can be observed at different stoichiometric ratios of Fe:TAAQ as Fe 2p core level shifts in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Scanning tunneling microscopy experiments confirmed the formation of metal–organic coordination structures. The striking feature of these structures is their irregularity, which indicates the presence of multiple local binding motifs. Density functional theory calculations confirm several energetically accessible Fe:TAAQ isomers, which accounts for the non-uniformity of the chains. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This difficulty in cutting is greatly ameliorated, if the workpiece surface ahead of the chip formation region is coated with certain chemical media such as glues, inks, and alcohols that are quite benign. High-speed imaging shows that the media effect a change in the local plastic deformation mode, from sinuous flow to one characterized by periodic fracture—segmented flow. This flow transition, due to a mechanochemical effect, results in significant reduction of deformation forces and energy, often > 50%, thus facilitating the cutting. The effect is mostly pronounced at smaller undeformed chip thickness, typical of finish and semi-finish machining regimes. The quality of the cut surface, as measured by defect density and surface roughness, improves by an order of magnitude, when the media are applied. Furthermore, this surface is relatively strain free in contrast to conventionally machined surfaces. The mechanochemical effect, with a strong coupling to the flow mode, is controllable, with the media showing similar efficacy across different metal systems. The results suggest opportunities for improving performance of machining processes for many difficult-to-cut gummy metals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ductile-brittle transition; Large-strain deformation; Mechanochemical effect; Metal cutting","Chemical bonds; Machining; Metals; Plastic deformation; Strain hardening; Surface roughness; Ductile brittle transition; High speed imaging; Improving performance; Large strain deformation; Local plastic deformation; Mechano-chemical routes; Mechanochemical effects; Undeformed chip thickness; Metal cutting",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CMMI 1562470, DMR 1610094; U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge support from NSF Grants CMMI 1562470 and DMR 1610094.

In today’s C2 systems, whether it is an air traffic control system or an integrated defense operation, the technological system only aids the human decision-making process and executes commands with limited opportunities to make decisions or perform actions on its own. However, future operational concepts of C2 systems demand agility and rapid decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. In these situations, intelligent systems could substantially complement human capabilities to meet the operational timeliness, precision, and complex needs. The objective of this paper is to formulate a conceptual design of future C2 system, composed of collaborative intelligent multiagent systems that autonomously conduct multi-step actions to efficiently and robustly achieve objectives. Using an example concept formulation of a cyber-physical command guided swarm (CGS), we develop a systems perspective of autonomous C2 that employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for developing the intelligent systems that utilize a game theoretic formulation for engineering collaboration strategies between these systems. The crux of the GAme theoretic Machine Learning C2 (GaMLC2) concept lies in introducing autonomy in the independent systems, which remain subordinate to their human commanders/operators while collaborating autonomously to accomplish the commander’s intent. � 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Rapid developments in the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have made its usage in a variety of offensive as well as defensive applications especially in military, high priority and sensitive government sites. The ability to accurately classify over-The-Air radio signals will provide insights into spectrum utilization, device fingerprinting and protocol identification. These insights can help the Warfighter to constantly be informed about adversarys transmitters capabilities without their knowledge. Recently, few researches have proposed feature-based machine learning techniques to classify RF signals. However, these researches are mostly evaluated on simulated environments, less accurate, and failed to explore advance machine learning techniques. In this research, we proposed a feature-engineering based signal classification (RF-class) toolbox which implements RF signal detection, Cyclostationary Features Extraction and Feature engineering, Automatic Modulation Recognition to automatically recognize modulation as well as sub-modulation types of the received signal. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach, we have evaluated the performance on a real environment with an UAS (Drone DJI Phantom 4). Our initial experimental result showed that we were able to detect presence of drone signal successfully when power on and transmitting. And further experiments are under progress. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In this approach, milligram quantities of a model yellow signal flare composition and its individual polymeric constituents were subjected to pyrolysis at conditions that were guided via thermal analysis. Many volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified as emission products even though thermochemical calculations fail to anticipate such products. Thus, these data may complement characterization of emission products predicted in silico. Pyrolysis of this pyrotechnic composition also demonstrated unique products formed via donation of nitrogen to aromatic fragments originating from resinous portions of the formulation. These products included EPA priority pollutants that were not formed by decomposition from staple ingredients. This work demonstrates that a variety of EPA priority pollutants were formed during the simulated combustion of what would otherwise be considered an environmentally friendly pyrotechnic. These pollutants originated from commonly used polymeric ingredients indicating the true environmental impact of many polymer-based energetics may need to be revisited. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Flare; Mass spectrometry; Perchlorate-free; Polymeric binders; Pyrotechnic","Environmental Protection Agency; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Inorganic compounds; Mass spectrometry; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Pyrolysis; Thermoanalysis; Volatile organic compounds; Flare; Perchlorate-free; Polymeric binder; Polymeric constituents; Priority pollutants; Pyrotechnic; Pyrotechnic compositions; Thermochemical calculations; Polymers",,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding and support from the United States Department of Defense (DoD), Naval Surface Warfare CenterCrane Division, under the Naval Innovative Science and Engineering (NISE) Program.

In particular, the influence of dynamic impact on battery behavior is investigated in terms of its effect on battery aging. Standard LiCoO2 electrodes were dynamically impacted using a nano-impactor setup, and the relationship between impact cycle number (N = 0, 3, 12, and 1000) and electrochemical performance is studied. Li-ion half cells constructed from impacted electrodes display decreasing first cycle Coulombic and energy efficiency with number of impacts, with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealing an increase in the charge-transfer resistance. Accelerated capacity fading through long-term cycling is observed for N = 1000 impacts, with significant voltage hysteresis and decay occurring by cycle 50. Additional ex-situ material characterization of cycled electrodes reveals a negative Raman shift by ∼2–3 cm−1 for the A1g and Eg bands for the N = 1000 case as compared to pristine LiCoO2, correlating to retention of material stress and electrochemical degradation via capacity fading. These results connect mechanical and electrochemical analysis of LIB electrodes, elucidating the relationship between dynamic impact and cell aging. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery aging; Dynamic impact; Electrode stress; Li-ion battery; LiCoO2 cathode","Battery management systems; Charge transfer; Cobalt compounds; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Ions; Lithium compounds; Battery aging; Charge transfer resistance; Dynamic impacts; Electrochemical analysis; Electrochemical degradation; Electrochemical performance; LiCoO2 cathodes; Material characterizations; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"N00014-15-1-2833, N00014-16-1-3109; Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Center for Advanced Materials Processing, Clarkson University, CAMP","The authors thank the Office of Naval Research (ONR) for supporting this project under Naval Enterprise Partnership Teaming with Universities for National Excellence (NEPTUNE) at Purdue Center for Power and Energy Research provided under grant number N00014-16-1-3109 (VP, VT, RA, BL, TA, JK) and N00014-15-1-2833 (VP).

A swab, attached to a metallic handle, was used to sample explosive residues and acted as the ion source. The explosives, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX), and 2,2-bis[(nitrooxy)methyl]propane-1,3-diyl dinitrate (PETN) had an absolute limit of detection of 10 ng from all the surfaces except for PETN from the nitrile gloves (limit of detection 100 ng). Sodium perchlorate, 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT) and tetra-butylammonium perchlorate had limits of detection of 100 pg, 10 pg, and 1 pg, respectively from all surfaces.

Devices often consist of numerous ICs from a variety of different manufacturers and procured through different vendors, all of whom may be trusted to varying degrees. Ensuring the quality, safety, and security of these components is a critical challenge. One possible solution is to use automated imaging techniques to check devices' physical appearance against known reference models in order to detect counterfeit or malicious components. This analysis can be performed at both a macro level (i.e., ensuring that the packaging of the IC appears legitimate and undamaged) and a micro level (i.e., comparing microscopic, transistor-level imagery of the circuit itself to detect suspicious deviations from a reference model). This latter analysis in particular is very challenging, considering that modern devices can contain billions of transistors. In this paper, we review the problem of microelectronics counterfeiting, discuss the potential application of computer vision to microelectronics inspection, present initial results, and recommend directions for future work. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Embedded systems; Integrated circuits; Microelectronics; Supply chains; Critical challenges; Critical infrastructure systems; Household products; Integrated circuits (ICs); Micro-electronic devices; Reference modeling; Reference models; Supply chain risk; Computer vision",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: RaPyDLI-1439007; Indiana University, IU; Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA: N00174-16","We thank Katherine Spoon for assisting with the Mechanical Turk study.

As a situation unfolds, maintaining awareness depends on diverse collections of data. In complex and dynamic scenarios, human operators face the difficult task of choosing which data to collect next. Hence, there is a need for multilayered fusion processes that exploit multiple models and levels of abstraction for understanding and sense-making Data collection has its roots in sensor management; however, there is an analogous need for data management - such as the incorporation of public domain data. Mature sensor management includes methods to utilize platform, sensor, and scene modeling so as to guide the user for future data collection. Additionally, these physics-based models could be a method to guide human-derived information models. Using the Data Fusion Information Group Model (DFIG), we develop an equivalent method for diffusion control. This paper focuses on recent techniques in statistical relational learning (SRL), Markov logic networks (MLN), and ontologies to support the control diffusion of data sensing to answer user queries. © 2018 ISIF","automation and autonomy; dissemination; Information fusion; machine learning","Data acquisition; Diffusion; Information fusion; Information management; Information use; Learning systems; Query processing; Data fusion information group models; dissemination; Information collections; Levels of abstraction; Markov logic networks; Physics-based models; Situation understanding; Statistical relational learning; Sensor data fusion",,,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research Naval Surface Warfare Center Computer Science Dynamic Data Driven App Sys.

We have previously demonstrated the application of charge-tagged phenyl radicals to explore the outcomes of these reactions using ion trap mass spectrometry. Here, we present a side-by-side comparison of rates and product distributions from the reaction of positively and negatively charge tagged phenyl radicals with dioxygen. The negatively charged distonic radical ions are found to react with significantly greater efficiency than their positively charged analogues. The product distributions of the anion reactions favor products of phenylperoxyl radical decomposition (e.g., phenoxyl radicals and cyclopentadienone), while the comparable fixed-charge cations yield the stabilized phenylperoxyl radical. Electronic structure calculations rationalize these differences as arising from the influence of the charged moiety on the energetics of rate-determining transition states and reaction intermediates within the phenylperoxyl reaction manifold and predict that this influence could extend to intra-molecular charge-radical separations of up to 14.5 Å. Experimental observations of reactions of the novel 4-(1-carboxylatoadamantyl)phenyl radical anion confirm that the influence of the charge on both rate and product distribution can be modulated by increasing the rigidly imposed separation between charge and radical sites. These findings provide a generalizable framework for predicting the influence of charged groups on polarizable radicals in gas phase distonic radical ions.

The PUF responses are digitized and processed on-chip to create keys for use in encryption and device authentication activities. Key generation and processing algorithms are presented that minimize the effects of voltage and temperature fluctuations to maximize the repeatability of a key within a device.

Despite the reported high current density at low temperatures, scandate cathodes have not yet seen wide-scale industrial adoption due to poor emission uniformity, inadequate reproducibility, and short lifetimes. This lack of industrial adoption stemming from the above issues is likely due to insufficient fundamental understanding of the role that scandium plays in the emission process. Recent work by five research teams under the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Innovative Vacuum Electronics Science and Technology Program aims at advancing this fundamental understanding and the cathode manufacturing processing. Emission microscopy of model surfaces of adsorbed Ba-Sc-O on single crystal tungsten and detailed characterization techniques, such as Wulff shape analysis, are being used to understand the morphology, composition and phase of each of the species that comprise the cathode emitting surfaces. The structure of tungsten grains at the cathode surface of activated and unactivated scandate cathodes and the resulting emission performance are observed. 3-D printing is being investigated as an advanced manufacturing method to meet the demanding requirements of modern vacuum electron devices. Finally, density functional theory is being employed to study the work function of perovskite oxides as a novel class of alternative materials to tungsten dispenser cathodes. © 2018 IEEE.","Cathodes; electron beams; electron emission; electron guns; electron tubes; scandate cathodes; thermionic emission; vacuum electron devices","Barium; Barium compounds; Cathodes; Current density; Density functional theory; Dispensers; Electron beams; Electron guns; Electron tubes; Electrons; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Manufacture; Microscopic examination; Perovskite; Single crystal surfaces; Single crystals; Surface treatment; Thermionic cathodes; Thermionic emission; Thermionic tubes; Tungsten; Vacuum technology; Work function; Advanced manufacturing; Alternative materials; Characterization techniques; Defense advanced research projects agencies; High current densities; Scandate cathodes; Science and technology programs; Vacuum electron devices; Electron emission",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, SPAWAR: N66001-16-1-4040, N66001-16-1-4041, N66001-16-1-4043, N66001-16-C-4033; Institute for Functional Nanomaterials, IFN","Research Projects Agency Innovative Vacuum Electronics Science and Technology Program aims at advancing this fundamental understanding and the cathode manufacturing processing.

Many of these sources are located in well controlled environments where high-quality coolant fluids are readily available. Others, however, are located on platforms where harsh environmental conditions exist, and high-quality coolants are not easily provided. This includes ships at sea and remote transmitters in the second-world and third-world countries. Corrosive ethylene glycol mixtures may be required where extreme temperatures are encountered. Essentially, all high-power RF sources are fabricated from brazed copper structures, which are particularly susceptible to corrosion from corrosive coolants. This paper demonstrates using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit nanometer-scale ceramic coatings inside coolant passages to separate the coolant from the underlying metal surface. This effectively reduces or eliminates corrosion and erosion, thereby increasing lifetime and reliability of RF sources. We describe ALD equipment and process specifically focused on RF sources and related components. The results of numerous experiments are reported, confirming the efficacy of the technology. © 2018 IEEE.","Corrosion; klystron; radar; reliability; RF sources; solenoids; transmitter; traveling wave tube (TWT)","Atomic layer deposition; Ceramic coatings; Corrosion; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Klystrons; Microwave tubes; Radar; Reliability; Solenoids; Transmitters; Traveling wave tubes; Controlled environment; Corrosion mitigations; Environmental conditions; Extreme temperatures; High-energy accelerator; RF sources; Third-world countries; Travelingwave tube (TWT); Coolants",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR: N00253-16-C-0002; U.S. Navy","Manuscript received October 31, 2017; revised December 14, 2017; accepted December 15, 2017.

Mouse tracking is an accessible, high-resolution measure that can be leveraged to understand the dynamics of perception, categorization, and decision-making in threat detection. Researchers have begun to utilize measures like mouse tracking in cyber security research, including in the study of risky online behavior. However, it remains an empirical question to what extent real-time information about user behavior is predictive of user outcomes and demonstrates added value compared to traditional self-report questionnaires. Participants navigated through six simulated websites, which resembled either secure ""non-spoof"" or insecure ""spoof"" versions of popular websites. Websites also varied in terms of authentication level (i.e., extended validation, standard validation, or partial encryption). Spoof websites had modified Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and authentication level. Participants chose to ""login"" to or ""back"" out of each website based on perceived website security. Mouse tracking information was recorded throughout the task, along with task performance. After completing the website identification task, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their security knowledge and degree of familiarity with the websites simulated during the experiment. Despite being primed to the possibility of website phishing attacks, participants generally showed a bias for logging in to websites versus backing out of potentially dangerous sites. Along these lines, participant ability to identify spoof websites was around the level of chance. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic models were used to compare the accuracy of two-factor (i.e., website security and encryption level), survey-based (i.e., security knowledge and website familiarity), and real-time measures (i.e., mouse tracking) in predicting risky online behavior during phishing attacks. Participant accuracy in identifying spoof and non-spoof websites was best captured using a model that included real-time indicators of decision-making behavior, as compared to two-factor and survey-based models. Findings validate three widely applicable measures of user behavior derived from mouse tracking recordings, which can be utilized in cyber security and user intervention research. Survey data alone are not as strong at predicting risky Internet behavior as models that incorporate real-time measures of user behavior, such as mouse tracking. © 2018 Kelley, Amon and Bertenthal.","Cyber security; Cyberpsychology; Human dynamics; Mouse tracking; Phishing; Statistical models; Threat detection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ablon, L., Libicki, M.C., Golay, A.A., (2014) Markets for Cybercrime Tools and Stolen Data, pp. 1-85. , Santa Monica, CA: National Security Research Division; Almuhimedi, H., Felt, A.P., Reeder, R.W., Consolvo, S., ""Your reputation precedes you: history, reputation, and the chrome malware warning, "" (2014) SOUPS '14: Proceedings of the Tenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 113-128. , Menlo Park, CA; Alsharnouby, M., Alaca, F., Chiasson, S., Why phishing still works: user strategies for combating phishing attacks (2015) Int.

Barium and oxygen diffuse to the emission surface whenever the cathode is hot to replace that lost by evaporation. The barium combines with the oxygen to form barium oxide, which reduces the surface work function. Barium that evaporates from the surface is deposited on nearby surfaces, including grids and high voltage electrodes. If the barium recombines with oxygen, it can result in spurious electron emission and arcing from these surfaces. This research is investigating surface coatings to suppress spurious electron emission from these surfaces by preventing barium oxide formation. © 2017 IEEE.","arcing; barium; electron emission; field emission; sputtered coatings; surface coatings","Barium; Barium compounds; Coatings; Electron guns; Electrons; Field emission; Field emission cathodes; Vacuum technology; arcing; Dispenser cathodes; High voltage electrodes; Spurious emissions; Sputtered coatings; Suppress spurious; Surface coatings; Surface work functions; Electron emission",,,,,"U.S. Navy: N00253-16-C-0002","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This development is funded by U.S. Navy contract N00253-16-C-0002.",,,,,,,,,,"Ives, R.L., Collins, G., Marsden, D., Karimov, R., Surious emission and arch suppression in electron guns (2016) IVEC 2016, , Monterey, CA, May",,,"Communication and Power Industry (CPI);CST;e2v;et al.;Inmarsat;TMD","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","18th International Vacuum Electronics Conference, IVEC 2017","24 April 2017 through 26 April 2017",,134626,,9781509059157,,,"English","IVEC - Int.

An advantageous method to enable lithium-ion cells to tolerate near zero volt conditions is to manage the amount of reversible lithium ions in a cell such that during near zero volt storage, the potential of each electrode is maintained outside of its damage range. Unlike current commercial methods, this method can be applied to lithium-ion cells in a full range of cell designs (i.e. high power, high energy density) using current state of the art active materials, electrolytes, and current collectors. In the present work, a scalable reversible lithium management technique using a bath cell is demonstrated for the fabrication of a zero-volt tolerant 225 mAh LiNiCoAlO2/MCMB pouch cell. An electrode asymptotic potential (EAP, the potential at which the electrodes asymptote to when the cell is in a near zero volt state) of 2.2 V vs. Li/Li+ was achieved in the final pouch cell as a result of the bathcell reversible lithium management step. The constructed pouch cell demonstrated ~100% discharge capacity and voltage retention after 14 days at a near zero volt state maintained by an applied resistor. Thus, the bath-cell reversible lithium management method can successfully fabricate reversible lithium managed lithium-ion cells that are highly tolerant to a prolonged (> 1 day) zero volt state. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electric discharges; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Storage (materials); Active material; Current collector; Discharge capacities; High energy densities; Lithium-ion cells; Management method; Management techniques; State of the art; Lithium-ion batteries",,,,,"Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL: FA9453-14-1-0239; Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking, SMART; Rochester Institute of Technology, RIT","The authors acknowledge financial support from the U.S. Government and the Air Force Research Laboratory under agreement number FA9453-14-1-0239.

Batteries undergo self-discharge and permanent loss of capacity at high temperatures, exhibit lower voltage and capacity at low temperatures, and leak electrolyte shortening operating lives, corrosion of nearby electronics, and potential safety hazards in the form of burns and poisoning. Instabilities in lithium types often short resulting explosions, fire, and venting of hazardous gasses. Betavoltaics do not have these problems and can operate in a wide temperature range without permanent degradation and loss of capacity, will not explode, and be made safe. Betavoltaic technology is maturing with advances in radioisotope sources, semiconductor materials, and developments in low-power applications, and has been identified by Department of Defense as a disruptive technology that is needed and should be pursued. This study presents experimental and modeling research on the leading betavoltaic technology, recent developments and proposed advancements. The next generation 100 microwatt betavoltaic is introduced along with projected voltage, current, and power characteristics.

Even though there have been multiple demonstrations, betavoltaic performance has not been extensively studied. To accurately predict betavoltaic performance, which is important for a device in operation without maintenance for elongated periods, all parameters are required to predict potential fluctuations in cell performance, such as doping densities and resistances for semiconductor variation and absorption coefficients for beta-generated current. However, not all parameters are easily measured, especially when the p-n junction is constantly under irradiation and cannot be separated from the source. Critical parameters were characterized experimentally with the betavoltaic cell by performing capacitance-voltage to determine doping densities and performing current-voltage characterization tests to determine resistances on multiple NanoTritiumTMcells, while absorption coefficients were determined from MCNP6 simulations. Experiments indicated that series resistance Rs was 1 × 106 Ω, while shunt resistance Rsh was 2 × 108 Ω from I-V characterization, while doping density ND was determined to be 1 × 1017 cm−3 from C-V characterization. Absorption coefficient α was found to vary with semiconductor material and incoming beta energy and used in conjunction with critical parameters from experimentation to accurately model betavoltaic cell performance similar to experimental results. Both implicit equations and explicit estimations were compared to model betavoltaic cell performance.

These properties were obtained on three betavoltaics under temperature cycles between −30 °C and 70 °C. Results indicated that the open-circuit voltage decreased as temperature increased and changes in short-circuit current were negligible, but betavoltaic cells were operational in the tested temperature range. In addition, a semi-empirical method to predict betavoltaic performance was developed. An I-V curve of the betavoltaic cell is taken at a reference temperature where the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current is derived.

The signal properties of the GPS signal are designed for position estimation, which makes it particularly suited for GPS PCL applications. The signal specifications are examined and the potential limitations of a proposed system are explored. Conventional GPS processing techniques are implemented in the framework of multistatic GPS PCL. GPS specific methods are developed for target position estimation of a multistatic PCL system in a three-dimensional plane. The PCL system has comparable performance metrics to conventional GPS positioning. Two methods are developed utilising measurements available in a conventional GPS system. The first involves a short time scale, which is in the order of milliseconds. The second involves a long time scale method, which is on the order of seconds. Simulation and analysis are performed to verify the methods.

This database consists of cross sections for 1253 [Pep + X] 2+ and 1035 [Pep + X + H] 3+ , where X 2+ corresponds to Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , or Zn 2+ . This number of measurements enables the extraction of structural trends for transition-metal-coordinated peptide ions. The range of structures and changes in collision cross sections for X 2+ -coordinated species (compared with protonated species of the same charge state) is similar to Mg 2+ -coordinated species. This suggests that the structures are largely determined by similarities in cation size with differences among the cross section distributions presumably caused by X 2+ interactions with specific functional groups offered by the residue R-groups or the peptide backbone. Cross section contributions for individual residues upon X 2+ solvation are assessed with the derivation of intrinsic size parameters (ISPs). The comparison of the [Pep + X] 2+ ISPs with those previously reported for [Pep + Mg] 2+ ions displays a lower contribution to the cross section for His, carboxyamidomethylated Cys, and Met, and is consistent with specific metal-residue interactions identified within protein X-ray crystallography databases.

This paper develops the mathematical framework and methods to estimate the velocity vector for a target in motion for a passive coherent location system. The developed methods show that there is an analytical solution to combine multiple bistatic measurements in different range and velocity domains for a velocity estimation in the global domain. The multistatic velocity estimation is compared to the traditional multi-time step bistatic PCL velocity solution. The conventional bistatic PCL velocity measurement requires two time steps of measurements, whereas a multistatic solution requires one. This can cause velocity measurement errors for a target with complex motion since the bistatic measurement will not be applicable at the next time step. The methods were tested in simulation for varying motion models, and experimentally verified for the simple linear motion constant velocity test case. The results show that the bistatic time method fails for complex target motion and the multistatic method is capable of determining velocity information in a single time step, as well as superior performance for complex target motion. © 2017 IEEE.","Bistatic Doppler; Bistatic Radar; Multistatic PCL; PCL Doppler Estimation","Doppler effect; Estimation; Location; Optical bistability; Radar; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Bistatic measurements; Bistatic radars; Doppler; Doppler estimations; Mathematical frameworks; Multi-static; Multiple transmitters; Passive coherent locations; Multistatic radars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuschel, H., O'Hagan, D., Passive radar from history to future (2010) Proc. 11th International Radar Symposium, pp. 1-4. , Vilnius, Lithuania, June; Kuschel, H., Approaching 80 years of passive radar (2013) Proc. 2013 International Conference on Radar, pp. 213-217. , Adelaide, Australia, Sep; Griffiths, H., Baker, C., Passive coherent location radar systems.

However, there are certain situations and environments in which high-energy electrons may also lead to soft errors. In this paper, we show that high energy electrons and the secondary particles created by them are capable of producing soft errors. In this paper, the energy dependence of electron-induced soft errors in a 28 nm bulk CMOS SRAM-based FPGA is recorded. Error rates are measured in both the embedded RAM and configuration RAM of the FPGA. This paper is the first research to explore the energy dependence of electron-induced single-event upsets in a commercial-off-the-shelf device. The measured electron-induced error cross sections are between 10-20 and 10-17cm2/bit depending on memory cell tested and the electron energy. Monte Carlo energy deposition simulations are used to further explore the mechanisms involved. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","FPGAs; radiation effects in ICs; single event upset; soft errors; SRAMs","Computer control systems; Digital storage; Electron energy levels; Electrons; Error correction; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Flash memory; Monte Carlo methods; Radiation effects; Random access storage; Static random access storage; Commercial off the shelf devices; Energy dependence; Energy depositions; High-energy electron; Radiation effects in ICs; Secondary particles; Single event upsets; Soft error; Radiation hardening",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC: NISE/Section 219","The authors would like to acknowledge the NSWC Crane FY16 Naval Innovative Science and Engineering (NISE/Section 219) program for support of this effort.",,,,,,,,,,"Sierawski, B.D., Muon-induced single event upsets in deepsubmicron technology (2010) IEEE Trans.

In laboratory-scale testing, three candidate formulations met or surpassed performance metrics of luminous intensity, dominant wavelength, color purity, and burn time when compared to a mock Mk 144 formulation which currently utilizes the environmentally hazardous potassium perchlorate. Also, one identified formulation does not utilize any barium compounds which may be the focus of future regulations. Furthermore, these candidate systems exhibited similar insensitivity to electrostatic, friction, and impact ignition stimuli in comparison to the mock Mk 144 formulation. Therefore, replacement formulations for the Mk 144 marine smoke and illumination signal have been identified with increased performance, environmental sustainability, and acceptable safety characteristics. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

Typically, PCL uses civilian communication transmitters not ideally suited for radar. The physical geometry of PCL is developed on the basis of bistatic radar without control of the transmitter antenna or waveform design. This poses the problem that often the receiver is designed with two antennas and channels, one for reference and one for surveillance. The surveillance channel is also contaminated with the direct signal and thus direct signal suppression (DSS) techniques must be used. This paper proposes an analytical solution based around hardware for DSS which is compared to other methods available in the literature. The methods are tested in varying bistatic geometries and with varying target radar cross section (RCS) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). © 2017 SPIE.","bistatic PCL; FM PCL; Passive coherent location; PCL DSS; PCL hardware","Antennas; Hardware; Location; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar systems; Signal to noise ratio; Transmitters; Bistatic; Detection and tracking; Illumination sources; Mixing techniques; Passive coherent locations; PCL DSS; Physical geometry; Transmitter antennas; Radar cross section",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuschel, H., O'Hagan, D., Passive radar from history to future (2010) Proc. 11th International Radar Symposium, pp. 1-4. , Vilnius, Lithuania, June; Kuschel, H., Approaching 80 years of passive radar (2013) Proc. 2013 International Conference on Radar, pp. 213-217. , Adelaide, Australia, Sep; Griths, H., Baker, C., Passive coherent location radar systems.

Many developments and improvements of PCL implement pseudo-monostatic and bistatic radar configurations; however, with the proliferation of commercial communication systems, the spectrally dense environment suggests the use of a heterogenous multistatic PCL system. This paper develops error minimization criteria to adjust and optimize available resources to a wideband PCL receiver. The method introduces the concept of self ambiguity as an error metric and implements this as a criterion to test varying PCL scenarios with differing transmitter modulation waveforms.

An example method is discussed for establishing a Safe Operating Area using a one-sided statistical tolerance limit based on the number of test samples.

The PSO algorithm computes optimal or near-optimal solutions so rapidly that multiple assets can be exploited in real-time and re-optimized on the fly as the situation changes. The allocation of assets in 3D space requires a blend of human intelligence and computational optimization. This paper advances the research on the tough problem of how humans interface to the swarm for directing the solution. The human intelligence places new pheromone-inspired spheres of influence to direct the final solution. The swarm can then react to the new input from the human intelligence. Our results indicate that this method can maintain the speed goal of less than 1 second, even with multiple spheres of pheromone influence in the solution space. © 2016 IEEE.","3D graphics; Blended intelligence; Human in the swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Pheromones; Terrain","Electronic warfare; Frequency allocation; Investments; 3D graphics; Blended intelligence; Human in the swarm; Pheromones; Terrain; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eberhart, R., Kennedy, J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory (1995) Micro Machine and Human Science, 1995.

Betavoltaics, which operate similar to photo voltaics, can operate in a wide temperature range safely without permanent degradation. Though not a new concept, which began in the 1950’s and peaked in the mid 1970’s, research has been minimal and sporadic until recent advancements in ultra-low power electronics and materialization of low power applications. The technology is rapidly maturing, generating research, and development in increasing the beta emitting source and semiconductor efficiencies. This study presents an update on betavoltaic technology, results from temperature evaluation on commercially available General Licensed betavoltaic cells, development of a hybrid system for latent and burst power, modeling and simulation techniques and results, and current and proposed research and development. Betavoltaic performance was successfully demonstrated for a wide temperature range (−30°C to 70°C). Short circuit current and open circuit voltage were used to compare electrical performance. Results indicate that the open-circuit voltage and maximum power decreased as temperature increased due to increases in the semiconductor’s intrinsic carrier concentration. © 2016, Vinca Inst Nuclear Sci.

Shape-dependent rules for convex polyhedra such as cubes, nanorods, or octahedra exist, which describe far-field scattering and near-field enhancements. However, such rules are lacking for their concave counterparts, which include stellated structures. Here, the optical response of stellated Au nanocrystals with Oh, D4h, D3h, C2v, and Td symmetry were modeled to systematically investigate the role of symmetry, branching, and particle orientation with respect to excitation source using finite difference time domain (FDTD) calculations. Furthermore, these results are compared to experimentally obtained localized surface plasmon bands determined by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy for ensembles of similarly shaped metallic nanostructures. These UV-vis spectra include that of the first reported all-Au octopodal structure achieved from seed-mediated methods. From these studies, symmetry-dependent rules governing the far-field and near-field optical response are outlined.

This capability would expand the amount of achievable beam-bandwidth for a fixed amount of digital I/O available between hierarchical beamforming nodes or would reduce the needed digital I/O capacity of a digital phased array. This work shows the potential for implementing signal predetection in digital phased arrays with distributed signal processing, and by using a hybrid detection methodology that combines binary integration and standard coherent processing at final beamforming nodes, digital I/O capacity needs are reduced while maintaining detection sensitivity of a standard coherent phased array architecture. © 2016 IEEE.","Antennas; Digital beamforming; Phased arrays; Radar","Antennas; Beam forming networks; Beamforming; Digital signal processors; Radar; Radar signal processing; Binary integration; Coherent processing; Detecting systems; Detection sensitivity; Digital beam forming; Distributed signal processing; Phased array architecture; Phased array radars; Antenna phased arrays",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harger, M.A., A digital architecture for phased array radar (2012) M.S Thesis, Dept. of Elec. and Comp.

Presently, most portable devices run off a Lithium-Iodide battery, which gives a high amount of power but could only last approximately 2 to 5 years, requiring frequent replacement. However, replacement is unnecessary for betavoltaic cells as they can last at least 20 years. City Labs Inc. received a general license for commercially available tritium betavoltaic cells that were validated at extreme temperatures without permanent degradation. To fully determine the effectiveness of a betavoltaic cell, the electrical performance (I-V curves) of three betavoltaics were evaluated while temperatures were ramped up and down from -30°C to 70°C. Short circuit current, open circuit voltage, maximum power and fill factor were used to compare electrical performance. Results indicated that the open-circuit voltage and maximum power decreased as temperature increased, suggesting that betavoltaic cells are suited for cold environments below 0°C, such as during nightfall when a photovoltaic cell may not be used.

Many developments and improvements of PCL implement pseudo-monostatic and bistatic radar configurations; however, with the proliferation of commercial communication systems, the spectrally dense environment proves to be in favor of a multistatic PCL system. In the multistatic case, it can be shown that geolocation of a target is a unique extension of multilateration algorithms. In multilateration, the receiver location is unknown and calculated by exploiting the intersections of distances from receiver to transmitters; in multistatic PCL, an object location is unknown and the intersection of transmitter distance to receiver and reflection distance to receiver are utilized. Multilateration is a well-studied topic where there are many developed techniques that can be applied after the reflection distance is derived with ray tracing principles. The framework for a time-of-arrival based multistatic PCL is provided using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) as a measure of propagation time and path length. A nonlinear multilateration solver using a least means square algorithm calculates the geolocation of the object within a tolerable error. Using a frequency modulated (FM) test signal, simulated results show comparable results to a bistatic PCL system using angular measurements for geolocation. Furthermore, a multistatic multilateration system is more tolerant to timing errors compared to a bistatic system with angular inaccuracy. The developed multistatic PCL system is realized and verified using an FM signal. © 2016 SPIE.","FM PCL; Multilateration PCL; Multistatic PCL; Passive coherent location; Time-difference-of-arrival","Angle measurement; Direction of arrival; Frequency modulation; Location; Radar; Radar equipment; Ray tracing; Time difference of arrival; Time of arrival; Tracking (position); Transmitters; Commercial communication; Detection and tracking; Illumination sources; Multi-static; Multilateration algorithms; Multilateration system; Passive coherent locations; Time difference of arrival (TDOA); Multistatic radars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fennessy, E., Radio aids to navigation the pioneer days (1979) Journal of Navigation, 32 (1), pp. 1-16; Brodeur, L.R., (1985) Loran-C Navigation Apparatus, , July 30 US Patent; Adamy, D., (2004) EW 102: A Second Course in Electronic Warfare, , Artech House, Boston, MA; Geyer, M., Daskalakis, A., Solving passive multilateration equations using Bancroft's algorithm (1998) Proceedings of the 17th AIAA/IEEE/SAE Digital Avionics Systems Conference, 2, pp. F41/1-F41/8. , IEEE, Bellevue, WA Oct.-Nov; Cheng, B.H., Hudson, R.E., Lorenzelli, F., Vandenberghe, L., Yao, K., Distributed Gauss-Newton method for node localization in wireless sensor networks (2005) Proceedings of the 6th IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, pp. 915-919. , IEEE, New York, NY June; Chernyak, V.S., (1998) Fundamentals of Multisite Radar Systems: Multistatic Radars and Multiradar Systems, , Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Willis, N.J., (2005) Bistatic Radar, , SciTech Publishers, Raleigh, NC; Tsui, J.B.-Y., (2000) Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers, , Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY; Richards, M.A., Scheer, J.A., Holm, W.A., (2010) Principles of Modern Radar, 1. , SciTech Publishers, Raleigh, NC; Griffiths, H., Baker, C., Passive coherent location radar systems.

To our knowledge however, relatively little research has been conducted with the goal to produce a totally nonmagnetic material. This phrase in our case means after spatially averaging over macroscopic volumes, it possesses an average zero DC magnetic susceptibility. We report measurements of the DC magnetic susceptibility of three different types of nonmagnetic materials at room temperature: (I) solutions of paramagnetic salts and diamagnetic liquids, (II) liquid gallium-indium alloys and (III) pressed powder mixtures of tungsten and bismuth. The lowest measured magnetic susceptibility among these candidate materials is in the order of 10-9 cgs volume susceptibility units, about two orders of magnitude smaller than distilled water. In all cases, the measured concentration dependence of the magnetic susceptibility is consistent with that expected for the weighted sum of the susceptibilities of the separate components within experimental error. These results verify the well-known Wiedemann additivity law for the magnetic susceptibility of inert mixtures of materials and thereby realize the ability to produce materials with small but tunable magnetic susceptibility. For our particular scientific application, we are also looking for materials with the largest possible number of neutrons and protons per unit volume. The gallium-indium alloys fabricated and measured in this work possess to our knowledge the smallest ratio of volume magnetic susceptibility to nucleon number density per unit volume for a room temperature liquid, and the tungsten-bismuth pressed powder mixtures possess to our knowledge the smallest ratio of volume magnetic susceptibility to nucleon number density per unit volume for a room temperature solid. This ratio is a figure of merit for a certain class of precision experiments that search for possible exotic spin-dependent forces of Nature. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","high nucleon density low magnetic susceptibility; low magnetic susceptibility; nonmagnetic masses; novel materials; spin dependent interactions","Bismuth; Bismuth alloys; Diamagnetic materials; Gallium; Gallium alloys; Indium; Indium alloys; Liquids; Magnetic susceptibility; Mixtures; Tungsten; Concentration dependence; DC magnetic susceptibility; Non-magnetic materials; Nonmagnetics; Novel materials; Scientific applications; Spin dependent forces; Spin-dependent interactions; Magnetism",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS: 1068712, 1156540, 1306942",,,,,,,,,,,"Dang, H.B., Maloof, A.C., Romalis, M.V., (2010) Appl.

PSO has been applied to the autonomous abet management problem in electronic warfare where the speed provides fast optimization of frequency allocations for receivers and jammers in highly complex and dynamic environments in our previous work. In this optimization problem, one key part of the fitneb is adapted by the human: the 2D (and future 3D) battlefield environment. This paper explores the use of the human in the fitneb function, adapting to the battlefield conditions as the PSO is acting. Two aspects of dynamic human influence will be discubed: Simple geometric zones and pheromone influenced zones. © 2015 IEEE.","Abet Allocation; Electronic Warfare; Human in the Swarm; Particle Swarm Optimization","Electronic warfare; Frequency allocation; Optimization; Abet Allocation; Battlefield environments; Dynamic environments; Fast optimizations; Human in the Swarm; Human influences; Management problems; Optimization problems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,"Academia Sinica; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 107-2627-M-001-006","This research was supported by Academia Sinica and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST Grant 107-2627-M-001-006).

However, decoupling the complex compositional and structural contributions to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) remains a challenge, especially when the monometallic counterparts are not synthetically accessible for comparison. Here, stellated Au-Pd nanocrystals (NCs) with Oh symmetry are used as a model system to decouple structural and complex compositional effects on LSPR. Single-particle correlation of the LSPR with the structure of octopodal Au-Pd NCs was achieved using optical dark-field spectroscopy with scanning electron microscopy. These measurements were compared to calculations of the optical properties of structurally similar Au-only octopods by the finite difference time domain method. This comparison enabled the role of complex composition, which was determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectrometry measurements, on the LSPR to be elucidated from the structural contributions. This methodology provides a powerful framework to guide the design of new plasmonic colloids through both structure and composition. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Colloids; Electron microscopy; Finite difference time domain method; Gold alloys; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanocrystals; Optical correlation; Optical properties; Palladium compounds; Plasmons; Scanning electron microscopy; Structure (composition); Surface plasmon resonance; Transmission electron microscopy; Bimetallic nanostructures; Compositional effects; Dark-field spectroscopy; Energy dispersive spectrometry; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Single-particle correlation; Tunable optical properties; Time domain analysis",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1306853",,,,,,,,,,,"Link, S., El-Sayed, M.A., Shape and Size Dependence of Radiative, Non-Radiative and Photothermal Properties of Gold Nanocrystals (2000) Int.

It regularly and substantially outperforms other algorithms in benchmark tests. This paper describes research leading to the application of PSO to the autonomous asset management problem in electronic warfare. The PSO speed provides fast optimization of frequency allocations for receivers and jammers in highly complex and dynamic environments. The key contribution is the simultaneous optimization of the frequency allocations, signal priority, signal strength, and the spatial locations of the assets. The fitness function takes into account the assets' locations in 2 and 3 dimensions maximizing their spatial distribution while maintaining allocations based on signal priority and power. The fast speed of the optimization enables rapid responses to changing conditions in these complex signal environments, which can have real-time battlefield impact. Initial results optimizing receiver frequencies and locations in 2 dimensions have been successful. Current run-times are between 300 (3 receivers, 30 transmitters) and 1000 (7 receivers, 30 transmitters) milliseconds on a single-threaded x86 based PC. Statistical and qualitative tests indicate the swarm has viable solutions, and finds the global optimum 99% of the time on a test case. The results of the research on the PSO parameters and fitness function for this problem is demonstrated. © 2015 IEEE.","Asset Allocation; Electronic Warfare; Particle Swarm Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Electronic warfare; Frequency allocation; Investments; Location; Transmitters; Asset allocation; Dynamic environments; Management problems; Multiple-objectives; Rapid optimization; Receiver frequency; Simultaneous optimization; Swarm Intelligence; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kennedy, J., Eberhart, R., Particle swarm optimization (1995) Neural Networks 1995.

To achieve ever increasing energy densities and faster controlled release of that energy, all materials of construction must be constantly evaluated from electrode to casing and everything in-between. Increasing the energy density of the cell improves its utility, but it also increases the waste heat and maximum potential uncontrolled energy release. Design agents and system developers need new ways to monitor and classify the probability and severity of the catastrophic failures as well as the system characteristics during intended operation. To support optimization of these battery cells it is necessary to understand their thermal characteristics at rest as well as under prescribed charge and discharge cycles. One of the many calorimetric tools available to observe and record these characteristics is heat flow calorimetry. Typically, a heat flow calorimeter is operated isothermally and measures the sum heat released or consumed by a sample material inside of a calorimetric measuring cell. For this study an improved calorimetric measuring cell for a modified Hart 6209 precision temperature bath was designed and constructed to measure the heat flow of larger electrochemical cells (18 × 8 × 16 cm). This new calorimetric measuring cell is constructed to allow independent measurements of heat flow among each of the sample's six sides in contrast to the typical one measurement of the average heat flow. Heat flows from 0.01 to 7.00 Watts were measured by the calorimeter with an average signal noise less than 1 mW during the charge and discharge cycles of the batteries under test. The heat capacities of the samples were also determined with experimental deviation of less than 2%. This paper provides a description of the calorimeter, calibration test results on its performance, and test results from two cells tested.

The experiment evolved from the need to recover shocked liner material to enable the analysis of relationships between microstructure and early liner collapse behavior. The research required material that had been shocked, yet was sufficiently intact to allow for metallurgical examination. Additionally, the experiment was designed to replicate the unique shock loading of shaped charge liners. Practically, the experiment had to be inexpensive to perform. The paper describes the experimental design, execution and validation and presents practical examples of the utility of the output. The experimental design is based on recreating a unique shock front, halting the deformation within a few microseconds and recovering material suitable for examination. Validation of the experiment employs a combination of available hydrocode modeling data and shaped charge liner collapse theory. The data collection supporting the validation was performed with computed tomography (CT) and laser generated 3D imagery. The output is recovered material valid for study. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Illicit or counterfeit electronic components include a broad category of devices that can range from the correct unit with a more recent date code to lower-specification or non-working systems with altered names, manufacturers and date codes. Current methodologies for identification of counterfeit electronics rely on visual microscopy by expert users and, while effective, are very time-consuming. Here, a plasma-based ambient desorption/ionization source, the flowing atmospheric pressure afterglow (FAPA) is used to generate a mass-spectral fingerprint from the surface of a variety of discrete electronic integrated circuits (ICs). Chemometric methods, specifically principal component analysis (PCA) and the bootstrapped error-adjusted single-sample technique (BEAST), are used successfully to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit ICs. In addition, chemical and physical surface-removal techniques are explored and suggest which surface-altering techniques were utilized by counterfeiters. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,,,,,,"DE-FG02-98ER14890",,,,,,,,,,,"Pecht, M., Tiku, S., (2006) IEEE Spectrum, 43, pp. 37-46; Ukman, W.W.A.J., Chinese Counterfeit Parts Found in U.

This examination is paralleled with a discussion of the advances which have enabled the synthesis of structurally defined metal nanomaterials, as these samples serve as the best platforms for elucidating the fundamental properties of plasmonic colloids. Based on the analysis of such samples, five guidelines are presented to aid the rational design and synthesis of new metal nanostructures for advanced applications in nanomedicine, energy, chemical sensing, and colloidal plasmonics in general. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,"colloid; gold; metal nanoparticle; silver; chemical engineering; chemistry; colloid; devices; genetic procedures; nanomedicine; nanotechnology; particle size; procedures; surface plasmon resonance; surface property; ultrastructure; Biosensing Techniques; Chemical Engineering; Colloids; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanomedicine; Nanotechnology; Particle Size; Silver; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Surface Properties",,"gold, 7440-57-5; silver, 7440-22-4; Colloids; Gold; Silver",,,"CHE-1306853; National Science Foundation, NSF: 1306853",,,,,,,,,,,"Willets, K.A., Van Duyne, R.P., (2007) Annu.

Because of the long experimental times often required in many accelerated aging programs, the need for faster and more reliable methods for investigating the degradative aging of polymeric materials under various environments becomes important. In this study, a micro-calorimeter was used in monitoring the heat flow as a function of time for a Nylon 6.6 polymer. Arrhenius model was used in fitting the data, following which activation energy was determined. The results obtained are consistent with published data for other sensitive measurement methods, but at a fraction of the samples and time. Implementation of technique and mitigation of weaknesses inherent in it will be presented and discussed.

Unlike traditional cameras that are used deliberately and sporadically, lifelogging devices are always 'on' and automatically capturing images. Such features may challenge users' (and bystanders') expectations about privacy and control of image gathering and dissemination. While lifelogging cameras are growing in popularity, little is known about privacy perceptions of these devices or what kinds of privacy challenges they are likely to create.To explore how people manage privacy in the context of lifelogging cameras, as well as which kinds of first-person images people consider 'sensitive,' we conducted an in situ user study (N = 36) in which participants wore a lifelogging device for a week, answered questionnaires about the collected images, and participated in an exit interview. Our findings indicate that: 1) some people may prefer to manage privacy through in situ physical control of image collection in order to avoid later burdensome review of all collected images; 2) a combination of factors including time, location, and the objects and people appearing in the photo determines its 'sensitivity;' and 3) people are concerned about the privacy of bystanders, despite reporting almost no opposition or concerns expressed by bystanders over the course of the study.

Calculations were performed for several different types of pyrotechnic formulations using the NASA Chemical Equilibria with Applications (NASA-CEA) program. Formulations used in devices including smokes, illuminants, signals, igniters, delays, and flashes were evaluated to determine the feasibility of using potassium ferrate(VI) as an alternative oxidizer. The calculated adiabatic flame temperatures and equilibrium combustion products for the proposed formulations were compared to those of common baseline formulations for different pyrotechnic applications to determine the likelihood of functional success of potassium ferrate(VI)-based formulations. Based on these initial data, it is highly probable that formulations incorporating potassium ferrate(VI) will result in reactive compositions for a variety of pyrotechnic applications. This material could address environmental concerns about perchlorate and heavy metal contamination by offering an environmentally- friendly alternative oxidizer. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In a radar system application, these randomized phased weights are applied over many time segments of a radar pulse compression waveform. Matched filters trained on the spatially varying signal projected in a particular direction respond preferentially to the signals in these directions, while partial orthogonality with respect to the signal in other directions allows for directionally dependent responses to reflected returns from a target. Effective transmit patterns for these matched filter banks are shown.

For example, where the code modulation used for pulse compression can be changed as a function of angle, such that the code of interest is only generated at the direction of the beam with different codes appearing just off the beam axis, allowing for angular discrimination based on the transmit signal. Target returns from within the main lobe or a side-lobe can be discriminated by intelligently transmitting different waveforms on different antenna elements, where the desired waveform is only formed external to the antennas in the air through wave combination. Therefore the angular pattern of the coherent return of the pulse will be different than the power pattern typically associated with the transmission from the array. In this paper, methods for constructing the waveform for relatively small, simple four-element arrays as a demonstration of how the concept could scale to larger systems. The directional modulation capability is shown by looking at the correlation of the code at various locations from the antenna array. The capabilities of the directional modulation effect were demonstrated by measuring the incident signal at various target locations, which was passed through matched filter bank to make angular determinations based on the relative peak magnitudes of each matched filter. © 2013 IEEE.","Antennas; Phased arrays; Radar; Radar antennas; Radar signal processing; Spread spectrum radar","Angular discrimination; Incident signals; Modulation capability; Modulation effects; Phased array radars; Radar signal processing; Signal generation; Spread spectrum radars; Antenna phased arrays; Antennas; Filter banks; Matched filters; Modulation; Pattern matching; Radar; Radar antennas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Daly, M., Daly, E., Bernhard, J., Demonstration of directional modulation using a phased array (2010) Antennas and Propagation, IEEE Transactions on, 58 (5), pp. 1545-1550. , may; Fulton, C., Clough, P., Pai, V., Chappell, W., A digital array radar with a hierarchical system architecture (2009) Microwave Symposium Digest, 2009.

In this article, the microstructural characteristics for specific grains to form whiskers in β-Sn films are discussed in light of our recent whisker growth model, establishing a relationship among grain boundary sliding limited Coble creep, surface grain geometry, and film stress for different stress conditions, including for thermal cycling. Through our recent finite-element simulations of stresses induced by room-temperature aging and thermal cycling of textured microstructures, the role of elastic and thermoelastic anisotropy in creating preferred whisker formation sites and the general propensity of a film to form whiskers have been proposed for a range of β-Sn film textures. Taken together, these models suggest a strategy for identifying the effects of local microstructure and β-Sn anisotropy on whisker formation. If these predictions are accurate, then whisker growth risk may be effectively reduced by engineering film microstructures and textures for specific applications and stress conditions. © 2013 TMS.",,"Film microstructures; Finite element simulations; Grain boundary properties; Hillock formation; Micro-structural characteristics; Predictive modeling; Textured microstructure; Whisker formation; Anisotropy; Crystal whiskers; Film growth; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Textures; Thermal cycling; Tin",,,,,"DE-FG02-05ER15637; National Science Foundation, NSF: EAR-0337006; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: 0416243; Cisco Systems; Office of Science, SC; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","would like to thank Dr. Peng Su, Maureen Williams, and Dr. Anthony Rollett for valuable discussions and Dr. Martin Kunz and Dr. Nobumichi Tamura for assistance with data extraction and analysis.

This technology could enable vision around corners or barriers, and allow covert, secure, and wireless distribution of scope images to other squad helmet mounted displays (HMDs), with minimal additional hardware to the current equipment. A major design challenge for FSO links in personnel applications is ensuring line of sight (LoS) between transmitter and receiver. This work captures warfighter helmet and gun movement using video motion tracking in a typical application for FSO data links. A method to simulate transmitter and receiver on the warfighter helmet and gun scope and analyze LoS and FOV is presented. This method allows optimization of FSO data link placement and provides requirements for future FSO technology. The initial results suggest that to meet 100% of the threshold requirements, the vertical FOV of a receiver must be 80° and the horizontal FOV must be 60° and oriented 10° in pitch and -7.5° in yaw. Simulating a FSO link with horizontal and vertical FOV of 60° shows expected performance using a visual method from a helmet mounted camera. Additionally, the FOV of the transmitter and receiver can be visualized with arbitrary FOV, position, and orientation. © 2013 SPIE.","Free space optical communication; Image processing; Motion tracking; Pointing acquisition and tracking","Free Space Optical communication; Free-space optical; Motion tracking; Pointing acquisition and tracking; Transmitter and receiver; Typical application; Wireless Data links; Wireless distribution; Computer simulation; Helmet mounted displays; Image processing; Safety devices; Transmitters; Optical data processing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tofsted, D., O'Brien, S., D'Arcy, S., Creegan, E., Elliott, S., An examination of the feasibility of ultrasonic communication links (2010) Army Research Laboratory, Computational and Information Sciences Directorate, White Sands, NM, Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL-TR-5200; Sun, Z., Akyildiz, I.F., Underground wireless communication using magnetic induction (2009) IEEE International Conference on Communications, pp. 1-5. , Dresden, Germany, 14-18, June; (2013) Canon U.S.A. : Professional Imaging Products : Free Space Optics., , http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/free_space_optics, Canon, Inc, Online; (2013) Lightspeed B10, , http://www.tplogic.com/products.php, Torrey Pines Logic, Inc., [Online; Moriarty, D., Hombs, B., System design of tactical communications with solar blind ultraviolet non line-of-sight systems (2009) Military Communications Conference, pp. 1-7. , Boston, MA, 18-21 October; Strauss, M., Volfson, L., Non-RF wireless helmet-mounted display and two-way audio connectivity using covert free-space optical communications (2011) SPIE Display Technologies and Applications for Defense, Security, and Avionics V, and Enhanced and Synthetic Vision, pp. 804201-8042012. , Orlando, Florida, USA, 25 April; Multiservice tactics, techniques, and procedures for tactical convoy operations (2009) Field Manual FM, , Department of Army, "", "" Department of Army, Washington, D.C., 4-01.45; Motor transportation operations (1997) Field Manual FM, pp. 30-55. , Department of the Army, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C; Browning machine gun, caliber.50 hb, m2 (2005) Field Manual FM, , Department of Army, "", "" Department of Army, Washington, D.C., 3-22.65; Crew served weapons (2006) Field Manual FM, , Department of Army, Department of Army, Washington, D.C. 3- 22.68; Craig, J.J., (1989) Introduction to Robotics, , Prentice Hall; Heng, K.H., Zhong, W.-D., Cheng, T.H., Multipoint free-space optics system for short-range communications between flight platforms (2010) Applied Optics, 49 (2), pp. 258-266. , January","Electro Optic Technology Division, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522, United States",,"The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)",,"Modeling and Simulation for Defense Systems and Applications VIII","30 April 2013 through 30 April 2013","Baltimore, MD",98190,0277786X,9780819495433,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881118587

In 1996, two papers were published in a special issue of the IEEE Transaction on Nuclear Science [Johnson, Palau, Dachs, Galloway and Schrimpf, 'A Review of the Techniques Used for Modeling Single-Event Effects in Power MOSFETs,' IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 546-560, April. 1996], [Titus and Wheatley, 'Experimental Studies of Single-Event Gate Rupture and Burnout in Vertical Power MOSFETs,' IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci., vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 533-545, Apr. 1996]. Those two papers continue to provide excellent information and references with regard to SEB and SEGR in vertical planar MOSFETs. This paper provides updated references/information and provides an updated perspective of SEB and SEGR in vertical planar MOSFETs as well as provides references/information to other device types that exhibit SEB and SEGR effects. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Dielectric rupture; power MOSFET; SEB; SEGR; single-event burnout; single-event gate rupture","Dielectric rupture; Power MOSFET; SEB; SEGR; Single-event burnouts; Single-event gate rupture; Electrical engineering; Nuclear energy; MOSFET devices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Johnson, G.H., Palau, J.M., Dachs, C., Galloway, K.F., Schrimpf, R.D., A review of the techniques used for modeling single-event effects in power MOSFET's (1996) IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 43 (2 PART 1), pp. 546-560. , PII S0018949996033370; Titus, J.L., Wheatley, C.F., Experimentalstudies of single-event gate rupture and burnout in vertical power MOSFET's (1996) IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 43 (2 PART 1), pp. 533-545; Brucker, G.J., Measel, P., Oberg, D., Wert, J., Criswell, T., SEU sensitivity of power converters with MOSFETs in space (1987) IEEE Trans.

Local grain orientations and strains measured by synchrotron microdiffraction in nine regions containing whiskers or hillocks were compared with elastic finite element analysis simulations including Sn elastic anisotropy. Whisker and hillock grains were observed to have higher crystallographic misorientations with neighboring grains than generally observed in the microstructure. While elastic simulations predicted higher local out-of-plane elastic strains and ESEDs at those locations with high misorientations before growth, synchrotron measurements of out-of-plane strains of whisker and hillock grains after growth showed relaxation, with correspondingly low ESEDs calculated from measured strains. Hence, highly localized out-of-plane elastic strains and ESEDs of grains with high relative misorientations with their neighbors determined, at least in part, which grains became whiskers or hillocks.

The cloud immerses a protected entity in a multitude of false targets by reradiating incident electromagnetic energy from millions of thin aluminized fibers, foil strips, or elements printed with conductive ink. The elements are cut to form resonant structures to match the principle threat frequencies, making them an effective reradiator. Empirically testing chaff clouds is technically challenging, costly, and time consuming. With an increased emphasis on chaff research comes the need to characterize cloud radar cross-section performance to expand existing knowledge and explore development opportunities for future technologies.

In many emergency or military applications, fixed network infrastructure may not be available or even possible. As mobile military data requirements grow, and spectrum limitations increase, systems must better utilise the diminishing available bandwidth of wireless radio frequency and free space optical links. To achieve better utilisation, disruption-prone networks require disruption-tolerant protocols or localised buffering to mask disruptions. Transmission control protocol (TCP)/IP assumes reliable links and performs well in networks with congestion dominated packet losses, but poorly with link failure dominated packet losses. Although TCP might be altered for disruptive environments, evolutionary reasons make it difficult to do so well without partitioning networks into reliable and disruption-tolerant systems. Instead, the authors examine transport layer aware helper protocols, with intermediate buffering in routers, to assist TCP across disruption-prone network portions. The buffering does not require TCP modifications at communicating nodes and integrate well with existing routers (i.e. TCP friendly). Experimental results show that TCP can reliably establish and maintain connections under poor link availability using the buffering protocol. Few TCP connections complete without it. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Available bandwidth; Data requirements; Fixed networks; Free-space optical link; Link availability; Link failures; Spectrum limitations; TCP connections; TCP modification; TCP-friendly; Transmission control protocol-friendly; Transport layers; Wireless radio-frequency; Military applications; Packet loss; Transmission control protocol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gerla, M., Tang, K., Bagodia, R., TCP performance in wireless multi-hop networks (1999) Proc.

Typical display devices tend to have an aspect ratio similar to 4:3 or 16:9, however a breed of Wide Field of View (WFOV) imaging devices exist that skew from the norm with aspect ratios as high as 5:1. This particular quality, when coupled with a high spatial resolution, presents a unique challenge for display devices. Standard display devices must choose between resizing the image data to fit the display and displaying the image data in native resolution and truncating potentially important information. The problem compounds when considering the applications; WFOV high-situationalawareness imagers are sought for space-limited military vehicles. Tradeoffs between these issues are assessed to the image quality of the WFOV sensor. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","displays; imaging; sensors; wide field of view","Data collection; Display technologies; Focal plane array technologies; High spatial resolution; Image data; Imaging device; Wide field of view; Aspect ratio; Aviators; Avionics; Display devices; Helmet mounted displays; Imaging techniques; Sensors; Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1997) iWear AV230 XL+, , http://www.vuzix.com/consumer/products_av230xl.html, Accessed 18 April 2012; Nicholson, G., Head-mounted display (HMD) assessment for tracked vehicles (2011) Proc.

These techniques are analyzed using a new layout aware single-event model with the Cadence Spectre circuit simulator. The techniques are applied in each of the three stages of an operational amplifier (op amp). The sensitive node active charge cancellation (SNACC) technique is applied to the bias circuit and extended to protect multiple sensitive nodes. This technique is shown to provide a 5X reduction in error energy measured at the amplifier output at the cost of increased sensitive area. The differential input stage and the high-gain single-ended cascode output stage of the amplifier are hardened using differential charge cancellation (DCC) layout techniques that promote charge sharing. These hardening techniques are shown to provide up to orders of magnitude reductions in single-event error energies as measured at the op amp output and reductions in sensitive area of more than 15% across all LETs simulated. © 2012 IEEE.","Differential charge cancellation (DCC); operational amplifier; radiation-hardening-by-design (RHBD); sensitive node active charge cancellation (SNACC); single-event effects (SEE)","Amplifier output; Bias circuits; Cascode; Charge cancellation; Charge sharing; Circuit simulators; CMOS operational amplifiers; Error energy; Folded-cascode; High-gain; Orders of magnitude; Output stages; Radiation hardening by design; Sensitive area; Single event effects; Single-ended; Single-events; Voltage transients; Circuit simulation; Operational amplifiers; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Hardening",,,,,,"Manuscript received September 16, 2011; revised December 28, 2011; accepted May 14, 2012.

This paper examines how GaN HEMT junction temperature determination can vary, owing to factors such as packaging variability, measurement error, and uncertainty in material property data. To demonstrate the impact of these variables, this paper uses practical examples of infrared thermography, micro-Raman thermography, device transient electro-thermal response analysis on GaN HEMT devices, and finite element analysis (FEA). These variations in temperature are combined into a probability model to estimate how life prediction will change as a function of these various factors. © 2012 IEEE.",,"GaN HEMTs; High-temperature environment; Junction temperatures; Life predictions; Material property; Micro-Raman; Probability models; Response analysis; Thermal factors; Chip scale packages; Finite element method; Gallium nitride; Radar systems; Thermal variables measurement; High electron mobility transistors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2006) Federal Research and Development Needs and Priorities for Phased Array Radar (FCM-R25-2006), , Interdepartmental Committee for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research, Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research, Washington, DC; Pribble, W.L., Palmour, J.W., Applications of SiC MESFETs and GaN HEMTs in power amplifier design (2002) Microwave Symposium Digest, pp. 1819-1822; Green, D.S., Vembu, B., GaN HEMT thermal behavior and implications for reliability testing and analysis (2008) Physica Status Solidi, 5 (6), pp. 2026-2029; Ohring, M., (1998) Reliability and Failure of Electronic Materials and Devices, , San Diego: Academic Press; Freeman, J.C., Channel Temperature Model for Microwave AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on SiC and Sapphire MMICs in High Power, High Efficiency SSPAs International Microwave Symposium, Fort Worth, TX, 2004; Prejs, A., Wood, S., Thermal analysis and its application to high power GaN HEMT amplifiers (2009) Microwave Symposium Digest, pp. 917-920; Jimenez, J.L., Chowdhury, U., X-Band GaN FET Reliability (2008) Reliability Physics Symposium, pp. 429-435; Copper Molybdenum Heatsinks, , http://www.planseetms.com/Copper%20Molybdenum%20Heatsinks.pdf, [Online].

The displacement damage induced by the neutron exposure prior to the single event experiment is shown to have little to no impact on the performance of the SRAM. However, the neutron fluence is able to induce small changes in the resistivity of the underlying silicon of the SRAM which leads to a large change in the multiple bit upset response.

By adapting weights of multiple transmit elements, coupled interference at receiver elements deconstructively interferes, providing up to 50 dB of additional isolation over the coupling of a single transmitter to a receiving element. Bandwidth considerations of the array are presented. It is shown that uncorrelated transmit noise from multiple transmitters can be removed through tunable filtering or through adaptive beamforming of multiple receiving elements, both providing an additional 30-40 dB of interference reduction that is tunable over the frequency range of the system. © 2006 IEEE.","Adaptive beamforming; antena arrays; communication front-end; duplexers; interference between wireless systems; multifunctional systems; tunable filters","Adaptive Beamforming; antena arrays; Duplexers; multifunctional systems; Tunable filters; Telecommunication systems; Transmitters; Beamforming",,,,,"Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","Manuscript received July 06, 2011; revised September 27, 2011; accepted September 30, 2011.

Full-duplex operation is possible through cancellation of the transmit signal at the receiver as much as 50dB. By exploiting symmetry in an array of antennas, a centrally located receiver is able to operate without saturation in the presence of high power transmit signals. The transmitters are able to provide spatial diversity and 360-degree azimuthal coverage while maintaining the requisite cancellation. We demonstrate the basic concept and then explore the criteria within the RF components needed to maintain suitable cancellation. © 2011 IEEE.","Active filters; active noise reduction; antenna arrays; frequency division multiplexing; interference cancellation; noise figure; power amplifiers","Active noise reductions; Basic concepts; Duplexing; Frequency division; Full-duplex; High-power; interference cancellation; Multi-antenna; Multiple antenna; Near fields; RF components; Spatial diversity; Active filters; Antenna arrays; Frequency allocation; Local area networks; Power amplifiers; Signal receivers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuo, S.M., Mitra, S., Design of noise reduction headphone (2006) Consumer Electronics, 2006.

Ferrite nanoparticles have been formed through both the polyol and aqueous co-precipitation methods that can be readily adapted to industrial scale synthesis to satisfy the demand of a variety of commercial applications. The structure, morphology and magnetic properties of Mg(x)Zn(1 - x)Fe2O4 were studied as a function of composition and particle size. Scanning electron microscopy images show particles synthesised by the aqueous co-precipitation method possess a broad size distribution (i.e. ∼ 80-120nm) with an average diameter of the order of 100nm 20nm and could be produced in high process yields of up to 25 gl-1. In contrast, particles synthesised by the polyol-based co-precipitation method possess a narrower size distribution with an average diameter in the 30nm 5nm range but are limited to smaller yields of ∼ 6gl-1. Furthermore, the polyol synthesis method was shown to control average particle size by varying the length of the glycol surfactant chain. Particles prepared by both methods are compared with respect to their phase purity, crystal structure, morphology, magnetic properties and microwave properties. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Average diameter; Average particle size; Broad size distribution; Commercial applications; Coprecipitation method; Ferrite nanoparticles; Industrial scale; Microwave property; Phase purity; Polyol synthesis; Process yield; Scanning electron microscopy image; Spinel ferrites; Surfactant chain; Crystal structure; Ferrite; Ferrites; Glycols; Gyrators; Magnetic properties; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Size distribution; Surface active agents; Toxicity; Zinc; Precipitation (chemical)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATDSR Toxicological Profile Information Sheet Database [Internet], , http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/index.asp, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) US Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ATSDR (web site).

The military and commercial use of HMDs was compiled from market research, market trends, and user feedback.

Reducing the footprint of displays inside turrets frees up space for the warfighter. Traditional military ruggedized flat panel displays cannot reside flush with the curved turret wall and consumes more space than their advertized size. The lack of turret space also makes balancing human factors difficult. To better meet the Warfighter needs, alternatives and incremental upgrades to the flat panel displays in turrets were compiled. Each alternative technology was assessed against the constraints of a turret. Benefits, issues, and predictions to implementation are summarized. Viable alternatives are being developed into suitable options. © 2011 SPIE.","Alternative; Flat panel display; Military; Ring mount; Vehicle turret; Vibration","Alternative; Alternative technologies;

Many existing assessment methods are available, but these are often subjective and unrepeatable. Repeatability, objectivity, and increased fidelity are desired. An architecture assessment methodology capable of achieving these objectives is possible by drawing on the strengths of existing approaches while addressing their collective weaknesses. The proposed methodology is the Canonical Decomposition Fuzzy Comparative approach. The theoretical foundations of this methodology are developed herein and tested through the assessment of three physical architectures for a peer-to-peer wireless network. An extensible modeling framework is established to decompose high-level system attributes into technical performance measures suitable for analysis via computational modeling. Canonical design primitives are used to assess antenna performance in the form of a comparative analysis between the baseline free space gain patterns and the installed gain patterns. Finally, a fuzzy inference system is used to interpret the comparative feature set and offer a numerical assessment. The results of this experiment support the assertion that the proposed methodology is well suited for exposing integration sensitivity and assessing coupled performance in physical architecture concepts. © 2010 IEEE.","Analytical models; architecture; fuzzy systems; system analysis and design; system performance","Analytical model; Antenna performance; Architecture assessment; Assessment methods; Canonical decomposition; Comparative analysis; Comparative approach; Computational modeling; Feature sets; Free space; Fuzzy inference systems; Gain patterns; High-level systems; Modeling frameworks; Peer to peer; Physical architecture; system analysis and design; System architects; System concepts; system performance; Technical performance measures; Theoretical foundations; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Mathematical models; Network architecture; Rating; Systems analysis; Peer to peer networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rechtin, G.E., (2000) Systems Architecting of Organizations-Why Eagles Can't Swim, p. 5. , Boca Raton, FL: CRC; Maier, M.W., Rechtin, E., (2002) The Art of Systems Architecting, 2nd Ed., , Boca Raton, FL: CRC; Rechtin, E., On boundaries and interfaces (1991) Systems Architecting- Creating & Building Complex Systems, p. 35. , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Levis, A.H., Research challenges in design and evaluation of system architecture (2005) 3rd Annu.

An approach is suggested utilizing computational intelligence, agent based modeling, and wireless ad hoc network simulation as a computational testbed for exploring the generalized dynamics of complex adaptive systems. Utilizing a standard 802.11 ad hoc protocol set, the network can be understood in terms of its capabilities and limitations. Agent based modeling facilitates the individual autonomy aspect of system of systems participants and is responsible for determining how a node will use the 802.11 protocol. Evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve the protocol usage strategies of the individuals. It is proposed that the evolutionary algorithm and agent based model provide the flexibility and autonomy needed to simulate a representative system of systems while the clear definition of the 802.11 protocol provides a framework for the experiment. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Agent based modeling; Behavioral dynamics; Computational intelligence; System of systems; Wireless networks","Ad hoc networks; Adaptive systems; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computational methods; Dynamics; Evolutionary algorithms; Software agents; System of systems; Systems engineering; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; 802.11 protocols; Ad hoc protocols; Agent-based model; Behavioral dynamics; Complex adaptive systems; Protocol usage; Systems of systems; Autonomous agents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamy, D., (2001) EW 101 a First Course in Electronic Warfare, , Norwood: Artech House; Alberts, D.S., Garstka, J.J., Stein, F.P., (1999) Network Centric Warfare, Command and Control Research Program (CCRP), , http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/Alberts_NCW.pdf; Bar-Yam, Y., A mathematical theory of strong emergence using multiscale variety (2004) Complexity, 9 (6), pp. 15-24. , DOI 10.1002/cplx.20029; Cloutier, R.J., Dimario, M.J., Polzer, H.W., Net-centricity and system of systems (2009) System of Systems Engineering Innovations for the 21st Century, pp. 150-168. , ed.

The experimental results for the SETs induced in two different inverter chain circuits indicate an increase in the average SET pulsewidth as a function of the operating temperature. Unique SET test structures were also designed to differentiate between SETs induced in an nMOS transistor and those induced in a pMOS transistor. The SET widths induced in a pMOS transistor increase more with temperature than the SETs induced in an nMOS transistor. © 2011, IEEE.

The RCA is comprised of a rack mount 2-18 GHz dual channel receiver and ruggedized COTS computer system running N1 (National Instruments) LabVIEW™. The dual channel receiver down converts both microwave inputs to a common intermediate frequency (IF) using a patented offset local oscillator technique. Both IF channels are sampled using a new SOA (State Of the Art) COTS (Commercial off The Shelf) digitizer. This new version of the RCA utilizes a new modified dual channel microwave down converter and a SOA 16-bit high-speed digitizer as opposed to the previous version which only used a 12 bit, to directly sample the IF allowing digital demodulation of AM (Amplitude Modulation) and PM (Phase Modulation) noise simultaneously. This second generation RCA prototype is used as AM/PM noise measurement system and has been built with a measurement single sideband noise floor of -155 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier.","AM; BMD; COTS; HSD; Noise; PM; Radar; RCA; Test","AM; BMD; COTS; HSD; Noise; PM; RCA; Test; Amplitude modulation; Instruments; Legacy systems; Measurements; Microwave oscillators; Military applications; Power amplifiers; Radar; Traveling wave tubes; Vacuum technology; Radar systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crespo, W., Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., RCA, Radar component Analyzer (2009) Proceedings of the ISA International Instrumentation Symposium, Technology Conference ISA IIS 2009, , TP09IIS004, June; Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., Novel, lower cost, noise measurement method (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE Systems Readiness Technology Conference AUTOTESTCON 2005, pp. 674-677. , October; Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., (2006) Dual Channel Downconverter for Pulsed Radio Frequency Measurements, , United States Patent 7058377, June; Crespo, W., Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., If sampling of TWT AM and PM noise using cross-correlation (2010) Proceedings of the ISA International Instrumentation Symposium, Technology Conference ISA IIS 2010, , TP10IIS0XX, May","Crespo, W.

The second generation RCA (radar component analyzer), which is a prototype system implements this novel measurement technique of cross-correlation noise averaging to reduce the effects of digitizer quantization noise. By sampling 0 and 90 degree versions of the IF(intermediate frequency) signals, the system can identify and remove digitizer-generated spurious tones from the noise measurement. This novel technique results in a processing gain of 5 to 10 dB increase of the noise floor as well as elimination or reduction of these spurious tones. This method takes advantage of using a SOA (state of the art) 16 bit digitizer with quad channel acquisitions to cross correlate the down converted signals and use phase detection algorithms to eliminate and reduce non DUT(device under test) induced noise creating a lower noise floor measuring a DUT.","AM and PM; HSD; IF; Noise; Radar; Test; TWT","AM and PM; HSD; IF; Noise; Test; TWT; Floors; Instruments; Legacy systems; Measurements; Power amplifiers; Radar; Radar systems; Traveling wave tubes; Radar measurement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crespo, W., Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., RCA, Radar component Analyzer (2009) Proceedings of the ISA International Instrumentation Symposium, Technology Conference ISA IIS 2009, , TP09IIS004, June; Crespo, W., Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., 2nd generation RCA (2010) Proceedings of the ISA International Instrumentation Symposium, Technology Conference ISA IIS 2010, , TP10IIS0XX, May; Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., Novel, lower cost, noise measurement method (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE Systems Readiness Technology Conference AUTOTESTCON 2005, pp. 674-677. , October; Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., (2006) Dual Channel Down converter for Pulsed Radio Frequency Measurements, , United States Patent 7058377, June; Walls, F.L., Extending the range and accuracy of phase noise measurements (1988) Proc.

It has been over a decade since this reliability prediction handbook was last updated, yet it remains the most widely used reliability prediction method for electronic equipment. In February 2008, the Defense Standardization Program Office (DSPO) tasked the Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane), as the Preparing Activity, to revise MIL-HDBK-217. A plan has been created to refresh the handbook and to look at adding a new approach to better reflect reliability of electronic equipment. A working group of individuals representing Department of Defense (DoD) and industry has been established to conduct this revision. Development and implementation of solutions that reflect industry best practices and DoD needs is critical for success. Results of this task are planned to be new revisions of MIL-HDBK-217. These revisions will provide an updated reliability prediction tool that will assist reliability engineers in performing their work.","Prediction; Reliability","Best practice; Department of Defense; Naval Surface Warfare Center; New approaches; Prediction; Reliability prediction; Standardization program; Working groups; Amplifiers (electronic); Cranes; Equipment; Forecasting; Handbooks; Maintainability; Naval warfare; Quality assurance; Quality control; Reliability analysis; Oscillators (electronic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Denson, W., (2006) Handbook of 217Plus Reliability Prediction Models, p. 146. , May; ANSI/VITA 51.1, American National Standard for Reliability Prediction, MIL-HDBK-217 Subsidiary Specification, VMEbus International Trade Association, 2008","Harms, J.

The RCA was developed by NSWC Crane to measure critical performance parameters of the AN/SPY-1 radar's components. Typical measurements include clutter attenuation, clutter improvement factor, intra-pulse noise, Moving Target Indicator residues, random pulse jitter, systematic pulse jitter, phase noise, and amplitude noise. The RCA is comprised of a rack mount 2-18 GHz dual channel receiver and ruggedized COTS computer system running LabVIEW. The dual channel receiver downconverts both microwave inputs to a common intermediate frequency (IF) using a patented offset local oscillator technique. Both IF channels are sampled using COTS digitizers at 400 MSamples/s with 72 dBc spurious free dynamic range. The digitized signals are then transferred to an external COTS computer system for digital down conversion, signal processing, and display. The RCA can measure radar transmitter and receiver components in-system using the radar's own waveforms. The RCA is compatible with BMDS radars that employ frequency diversity, staggered pulse repetition frequencies, nonlinear chirp pulse compression, and phase coding. Radar communication waveforms using complex modulations are also supported.","BMD; COTS; Noise; Radar; RCA; Test","Amplitude noise; Attenuation ,; Ballistic Missile Defense System; Complex modulation; Critical performance parameters; Digital down conversions; Digitizers; Dual channel; Frequency diversity; Improvement factors; Intermediate frequencies; LabViEW; Local oscillators; Moving -target-indicator; Noise radars; Nonlinear chirp; Phase coding; Pulse jitter; Pulse noise; Pulse repetition frequencies; Radar communication; Radar components; Spurious free dynamic range; Test and measurement; Wave forms; Ballistics; Clutter (information theory); Instruments; Jitter; Measurements; Microwave oscillators; Radar; Signal processing; Radar measurement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., Novel, Lower Cost, Noise Measurement Method (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE Systems Readiness Technology Conference AUTOTESTCON, pp. 674-677. , October; Mitsdarffer, K., Hoover, L., Thelen, D., Dual Channel Downconverter for Pulsed Radio Frequency Measurements, (2006), United States Patent 7058377, June","Crespo, W.

Logic circuits, i.e. CMOS inverter chains, were irradiated with cobalt-60 gamma radiation. When charge is induced in the n-channel FET with laser-probing techniques, laser-induced transients widen with increased total dose. This is because radiation causes charge to be trapped in the buried oxide, and reduces the p-channel FET drive current. When the p-channel FET drive current is reduced, the time required to restore the output of the laser-probed FET back to its original condition is increased, i.e. the upset transient width is increased. A widening of the transient pulse is also observed when a positive bias is applied to the wafer without any exposure to radiation. This is because a positive wafer bias reproduces the shifts in FET threshold voltages that occur during total dose irradiation. Results were also verified with heavy ion testing and mixed mode simulations. © 2009 IEEE.","Floating body; Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator; Gamma radiation; Heavy ions; Ionizing radiation; Laser irradiation; Single-event transients; Total ionizing dose","Floating bodies; Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator; Gamma radiation; Laser irradiations; Single event transients; Total Ionizing Dose; Bodies of revolution; Cobalt; Field effect transistors; Gamma rays; Heavy ions; High electron mobility transistors; Irradiation; Lasers; Logic circuits; MESFET devices; Microsensors; Radiation shielding; Radioactivity; Silicon on insulator technology; Silicon wafers; Static random access storage; Switching circuits; Transients; Radiation effects",,,,,"FA8721-05-C-0002; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 17, 2009; revised September 14, 2009.

Ordinarily, charge collection from an ion strike is assumed to occur only on a single node, but with decreasing feature sizes in nanometer technologies, charge sharing among devices is worsening, leading to charge collection on multiple nodes. When multiple SETs are considered, simulation results show a $380\ times$increase in cross-section with a four-bit carry look-ahead generator, and a $27\times$ increase with a four-bit arithmetic logic unit. Additionally, both circuits show a linear increase in cross-section as frequency increases. © 2006 IEEE.","CMOS circuits; Cross-sections; Digital circuits; Radiation effects; Radiation effects in ICs; Single event transients; Single-event effects","Carry logic; Digital circuits; Digital integrated circuits; Evaporative cooling systems; Radiation; Transients; CMOS circuits; Cross-sections; Radiation effects in ICs; Single event transients; Single-event effects; Radiation effects",,,,,"Boeing; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 11, 2008; revised September 04, 2008.

These small changes in threshold laser energy in the subthreshold region suggest that the cross-section curves as a function of power supply voltage remain relatively constant. Simulations show that the minimum pulsewidth required to generate higher-order oscillations decreases as operating voltage increases. Single-event transients are wider when circuits are operating in the subthreshold region than when operating at the nominal power supply voltages. Narrower single-event transients result for strikes on PMOS transistors as compared to those for strikes on NMOS devices in the subthreshold region; the opposite is observed when circuits are operating at the nominal power supply voltages. © 2006 IEEE.","CMOS circuits; Digital circuits; Radiation effects; Radiation effects in ICs; Single event transients; Single-event effects","CMOS circuits; Combinational logic circuits; Harmonic oscillations; Higher orders; Laser energies; Nmos devices; Operating voltages; pMOS transistors; Power-supply voltages; Pulse widths; Radiation effects in ICs; Section curves; Single event transients; Single-event effects; Stage ring oscillators; Subthreshold regions; Threshold lasers; Ultra-low-power; Digital circuits; Digital integrated circuits; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; High electron mobility transistors; Logic circuits; Motion estimation; Radiation; Static random access storage; Switching circuits; Transients; Radiation effects",,,,,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 11, 2008; revised September 04, 2008.

New experimental results and a critical evaluation of previous work demonstrate that, at high dose rates and/or in oxides with low concentrations of hydrogen, electrons can more easily neutralize slowly diffusing or metastably trapped holes via annihilation (recombination) or compensation (offsetting trapping) before the holes can release ${\hbox {H}}^{+}$. In contrast, at low dose rates and/or in oxides with higher concentrations of hydrogen, which can react with and modify the structure of O-vacancy-related defects, it is more likely that holes can release ${\hbox {H}}^{+}$ during transport. This is because the cross section for electron capture by ${\hbox {H}}^{+}$ is several orders of magnitude smaller than the electron capture cross section for a slowly moving or metastably trapped hole. This enhanced proton release at low dose rates or in oxides with high hydrogen concentrations can lead to increased interface trap formation, which is the most common source of enhanced gain degradation in lateral and substrate pnp bipolar transistors. © 2006 IEEE.","Enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS); Hydrogen; Interface trap charge; Linear bipolar devices; Oxide trap charge; Vacancies","Atoms; Biological radiation effects; Bipolar integrated circuits; Bipolar transistors; Degradation; Dosimetry; Electrons; Hydrogen; Lead; Nonmetals; Oxides; Protons; Silicon compounds; Transistors; Vacancies; Bipolar devices; Common sources; Critical evaluations; Cross sections; Electron captures; Electron-capture cross sections; Enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS); Gain degradations; High dose rates; Hydrogen concentrations; Hydrogen release; Interface trap charge; Linear bipolar devices; Low concentrations; Low dose rates; Lower probabilities; Orders of magnitudes; Oxide trap charge; Proton release; Vacancy-related defects; Substrates",,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA; Vanderbilt University, VU; U.S. Navy, USN","Manuscript received July 10, 2008; revised August 26, 2008.

Pre-irradiation hydrogen exposure makes the devices more sensitive to ionizing radiation, which is explained through first-principles calculations and numerical simulations. Mechanisms for the cracking of hydrogen molecules and proton generation are proposed. We also suggest a mechanism of formation of border traps. When protons are trapped by oxygen vacancies right at or very near the interface, they form electrically active defects near the middle of the band gap. Activation energies of the reaction are used to construct rate equations. The rate equations are solved numerically to determine the spatial and temporal concentrations of hydrogen, holes, and protons. The calculated concentrations of interface and border traps agree well with the experimental results and help to explain the role of hydrogen in determining the total-dose response of BJTs. © 2006 IEEE.","Hydrogen soak; Oxygen vacancy; Radiation; Simulations","Activation energy; Atoms; Bipolar transistors; Hydrogen; Ionizing radiation; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Protons; Radiation effects; Transistors; Vacancies; Band gaps; Border traps; Electrically active defects; First-principles calculations; Hydrogen exposures; Hydrogen molecules; Hydrogen soak; Mechanism of formations; Numerical simulations; Oxygen vacancy; Pre irradiations; Proton generations; Radiation; Radiation response; Rate equations; Simulations; Temporal concentrations; Total dose; Oxygen vacancies",,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR: FA9550-05-1-0306; Vanderbilt University, VU; U.S. Navy, USN","Manuscript received July 11, 2008; revised September 12, 2008.

Results obtained from irradiations performed on the HSYEl17 linear voltage regulator from Intersil and the AD590 temperature transducer from Analog Devices show a causal relationship between in-package hydrogen content and total dose response. Silicon nitride passivation has been found to play a key role in this study. A recommended approach to hardening bipolar linear circuits with poor total dose response is to characterize them as processed through metallization. © 2007 IEEE.","Enhanced low-dose rate sensitivity; Hydrogen; Linear regulator; Passivation; Radiation effects; Temperature transducer; Total ionizing dose","Analog devices; Bipolar linear circuits; Causal relationships; Enhanced low-dose rate sensitivity; Hydrogen contents; Intersil; Linear bipolar; Linear regulator; Linear voltage regulators; Metallizations; Silicon nitride passivation; Temperature transducer; Temperature transducers; Total dose response; Total ionizing dose; Bipolar integrated circuits; Electric potential; Electron traps; Hydrogen; Ionizing radiation; Passivation; Piezoelectric transducers; Silicon nitride; Voltage regulators; Radiation effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Camp Jr., W.O., Lasater, R., Genova, V., Hume, R., Hydrogen effects on reliability of GaAs MMICs (1989) proceedings of 11th GaAs Integrated Circuit Symposium, pp. 203-206; R.

Simulation results show that the choice of buffer, resistivity and thickness, is important in achieving the best device performance (i.e., to fabricate a device capable of withstanding a heavy ion environment under its full rated drain voltage without a significant increase in its on-resistance). Simulation results show that an optimized buffer layer is critical. In other words, if the resistivity is too low or high and/or the thickness is too thick or thin, the drain voltage at which SEB occurs decreases. This paper provides a methodology to select an optimized buffer layer resistivity and thickness. © 2007 IEEE.","Buffer layer; Power DMOSFET; Single-event burnout (SEB); Worst-case test condition","Drain voltage; Power DMOSFET; Single-event burnout (SEB); Survivability; Worst-case test condition; Buffer layers; Circuit simulation; Drain current; Electric conductivity; Epitaxial layers; Heavy ions; MOSFET devices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liu, S., Boden, M., Cao, H., Sanchez, E., Titus, J.L., Evaluation of worst-case test conditions for SEE on power DMOSFETs (2006) Proc.

Remanufacturing refers to the process of accepting inoperable units, salvaging good and repairable components from those units, and then re-assembling good units to be re-issued into service. These types of facilities are common, yet many suffer from the unpredictability of good and repairable component yields, as well as processing time variation. These problems combine to make it extremely difficult to predict whether overall production output will be sufficient to meet demand. Low yields of key components can lead to shortages which require the facility to purchase new components for legacy systems, often with long lead times, thus causing overall delays. The approach developed here is a probabilistic form of standard material requirements planning (MRP), which considers variable yield rates of good, bad, and repairable components that are harvested from incoming units, and probabilistic processing times and yields at each stage of the remanufacturing process. The approach provides estimates of the expected number of remanufactured units to be completed in each future period. In addition, we propose a procedure for generating a component purchase schedule to avoid shortages in periods with a low probability of meeting demand. The proposed methodology is applied to an antenna remanufacturing process at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). In this case study the proposed methodology identifies a potential shortage of a key component and suggests a corrective action to avoid significant delay in the delivery of remanufactured units.","MRP; Production planning; Variable processing time; Variable yield rate","Manufacture; Planning; Probability; Material requirements planning (MRP); Production output; Remanufactured products; Time variation; Production engineering",,,,,"University of Louisville, UL: 990053, 995005; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","The work presented herein was supported by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane through University of Louisville Awards 990053 and 995005.

Enhancements to performance, reliability, and cost of ownership are being applied continuously to these systems; routine in-service life extensions mandate continuing vacuum electronics research and development to support system needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, exciting advances in vacuum electronics will provide dramatic improvements in millimeter-wave radar resolution, broadband low-noise power at microwave frequencies, compact high power sources operating at lower voltages, and life-cycle cost improvement. Recent progress in key enabling technologies, e.g., advanced device modeling and micro-fabrication, is expected to continue.

Enhancements to performance, reliability, and cost of ownership are being applied continuously to these systems: routine in-service life extensions mandate continuing vacuum electronics research and development to support system needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, exciting advances in vacuum electronics will provide dramatic improvements in millimeter-wave radar resolution, broadband low-noise power at microwave frequencies, compact high power sources operating at lower voltages, and life-cycle cost improvement. Recent progress in key enabling technologies, e.g., advanced device modeling and micro-fabrication, is expected to continue. This reviews the status and trends of vacuum electronics, with selected applications emphasizing recent advances in device performance in the microwave regime: multiple-beam klystrons (MBKs), Microwave Power Modules (MPMs), and gyro-amplifiers in the millimeter-wave regime. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Cost of ownership; Microwave Power Modules (MPM); Multiple-beam klystrons (MBK); Vacuum electronic amplifiers; Amplifiers (electronic); Broadband networks; Microwave frequencies; Millimeter wave devices; Radar transmitters",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","This work was supported by the US Office of Naval Research.

The parts packaged in flat-packs show very large enhanced low dose rate sensitive (ELDRS) response for unbiased irradiation, starting at about 20 krad, whereas parts packaged in TO-52 cans are not ELDRS. The reason for this package sensitivity appears to be a result of hydrogen trapped in the cavity of the flat-pack package. The responses at 10 mrad/s and 3 mrad/s are essentially the same, indicating that the low dose rate enhancement factor has leveled off below 10 mrad/s. Elevated temperature irradiation at 100° C and 5 rad/s does not simulate the low dose rate response. © 2007 IEEE.","Dose rate; Enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity; Radiation effects; Temperature transducer; Total ionizing dose","Analog computers; Dosimetry; Hydrogen; Irradiation; Radiation effects; Sensitivity analysis; Dose rate; Enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity; Package sensitivity; Transducers",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA: N00164-02-D-6599","Manuscript received September 21, 2006; revised December 5, 2006.

After manufacture, the quantity and ratio of acid/water will continue to vary depending upon the conditions of storage and operation. The level of variation depends on many factors such as loading density, temperature, volume of ullage and sealing condition of the containing cartridge, just to name a few. As described in this paper and other literature, the degradation mechanisms and aging processes of NC/NG based propellants are extremely complicated. This paper describes the details of the application of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to study if the free-radical mechanism is involved in the decomposition of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. Due to the high free-radical intensity possessed by the propellant composition, we believe that a π complex intermediate may be formed between DPA and NG and/or NC. The formation of a .complex intermediate is not preferred because it may enhance the rate of decomposition of nitrate esters. Correlation between heat flow curve, stabilizer depletion and free-radical distribution has been evaluated. An intramolecular decomposition mechanism is preferred, because it prevents the possibility that the NOx from NNODPA or NNDPA may interact with the NC and NG again during the rearrangement process. Since the acidity of the propellant composition continues to change during the aging process, multiple mechanisms may proceed simultaneously. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper builds on earlier work by correlating plating cell and tank design issues and tank characterization studies with standard mechanical and reliability tests. The current work evaluates the resulting copper deposits in terms of throwing power, mechanical and reliability tests and compares the results to a current state-of-the-art process. The present work relies on electrical mediation for a highly controlled electrodeposition process that results in a very uniform and reproducible deposit; selection of the electric mediation parameters is based on considerations of mass transfer as well as microprofiles and macroprofiles related to current distribution. Data for plating industry test panels containing PTHs of approximately 5:1, 10:1, and 15:1 aspect ratios are presented. Using a pulse waveform sequence, throwing powers of approximately 90-100% are observed at plating rates of approximately 20 ASF.",,"Characterization studies; Current distribution; Effect of pulse; Electrodeposition process; Electronic interconnects; Electronic modules; Microprofiles; Plating cells; Plating industry; Plating rates; Pulse waveforms; Reliability test; Tank design; Test panels; Throwing power; Aspect ratio; Copper deposits; Cutting tools; Design; Exhibitions; Printed circuits; Tanks (containers); Deposits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paunovic, M., Schlesinger, M., (2000) Modern Electroplating, , Wiley Inc NY; Coughlan, S., (1995) Trans.

Transistor gain degradation is shown to be the dominant cause of the circuit degradation at lower dose rates. In addition, collector-to-emitter leakage current in one of the NPN transistors of the bandgap reference part of the circuit is responsible for increasing the postirradiation output voltage at high dose rates. Parametric changes in the bandgap, differential amplifier, and output pass transistor circuit blocks are identified that are responsible for various aspects of the observed circuit degradation. The different annealing characteristics of oxide-trap and interface-trap charge are responsible for the complex postirradiation recovery of the output voltage. © 2006 IEEE.","Enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity; IC radiation response; Linear bipolar ICs; Modeling and simulation; Radiation-induced leakage; Voltage regulator","Bandgap; Circuit degradation; Dropout voltage; Radiation induced leakage; Bipolar integrated circuits; Computer simulation; Differential amplifiers; Dosimetry; Energy gap; Leakage currents; Radiation effects; Transistors; Voltage regulators",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA; U.S. Navy","Manuscript received July 14, 2006.

During aging, PTFE seals of the glass ampoules used in the aging studies undergo a yellow discoloration. This report studies the discoloration of the liners using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI). a gentle surface analysis technique based on electrospray ionization. The color bodies in the PTFE liners were identified by DESI together with tandem mass spectrometry to be the nitrated derivatives of the diphenylamine stabilizer: dinitro-, trinitro-. and tetranitrodiphenylamine. While increased nitration decreases vapor pressure of the DPA species, an increase in solubility in the PTFE liners occurs. This may account for these species not previously being observed during early aging studies as they are preferentially absorbed into the liners, which were not extracted prior to high performance liquid-chromatography analysis. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

High maintenance costs due to high failure rates of the battery components prompted NAVAIR to begin a program to replace the commercial battery with a high-reliability military specification battery. The new design, specified as the M81757/18-1, uses modern materials and low-maintenance vented nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) technology. The prototype batteries were developed by MarathonNorco Aerospace Inc. Realizing that the charge algorithm of the present airborne charger was a very mild charge for a 20-cell nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery, prototypes of the new batteries were tested to verify whether the airborne chargers could keep them adequately charged. The present airborne charger could not keep the new batteries charged. The initial plan to insert the new technology battery into the existing airborne system would not work without changing the present airborne charger. Although the charge algorithm was a very gentle charge, there were reports about the present batteries overheating on the aircraft. The empirical evidence appeared to strongly contradict all operating descriptions of the airborne charger. To understand the reason for the apparent contradiction between the system operating description and actual occurrences, we began to study the airborne charge system. The more we learned, the more we realized that the whole system should be replaced.

After a medium caliber barrel failure, the Explosive Sciences Branch (ESB) of Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) performed metallurgical investigations on one damaged gun barrel, six additional barrels pulled from service and one new gun barrel. to determine if any inherent flaws or service conditions could have caused the failure. The metallurgical analysis included detailed microhardness profiling on several areas of each barrel, complete microstructure examination with a metallurgical microscope, crack depth determination via optical comparator, optical microscopy and SEM analyses on down-bore sections of the barrels, and geometrical analysis on the rifling of the barrels. Hardness differences were found between the outside edge and/or inside edge of the barrels versus the center or core of the barrels. Additionally, areas of no chrome coating, cracked coating, base metal cracking, and stress corrosion cracking were evident in the breech end of the barrel, while land damage/deformation was prominent in down-bore barrel sections. The ESa determined coating cracking and slight interface corrosion between the base metal and coating would lead to accelerated degradation (erosion, corrosion, cracking, etc.) of barrels in service. These findings show that many barrels still in use should be pulled from service and that better erosion/corrosion monitoring techniques need to be in place to better assess the condition and risk of barrels in service.","Barrel; Corrosion; Erosion; Failure; Gun; Metallurgy","Accelerated degradation; Barrel; Base metals; Catastrophic failures; Crack depths; Geometrical analysis; Gun; Gun barrels; Metallurgical analysis; Metallurgical investigation; Metallurgical microscope; Metallurgical testing; Microstructure examination; Monitoring techniques; Naval Surface Warfare Center; Optical comparators; SEM analysis; Service conditions; Chromate coatings; Computer system recovery; Corrosion; Cranes; Erosion; Machinery; Optical microscopy; Stress corrosion cracking; Systems engineering; Technology; Metallurgy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fassino, J.; Naval Surface Warfare Center, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522, United States",,"Office of Naval Research;U.S. Army Research Laboratory;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;Naval Surface Warfare Center",,"59th Meeting of the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology: Essential Technologies for Successful Prognostics","18 April 2005 through 21 April 2005","Virginia Beach, VA",93705,,,,,"English","Essent.

From the harsh environments experienced shipboard to erosion corrosion of gun barrels, there are continuing efforts to extend the life of products, reduce costs, and maintain superior quality. One way to achieve all these goals is to accurately predict corrosive environments and corrosion rates, and effectively minimize such atmospheres. The corrosive environments can be improved in several ways, innovative protective coatings, new materials, better monitoring, and new technologies to better predict corrosion and how it affects a given material. Predicting corrosion allows for service lives to be extended and maintenance costs to be reduced by knowing ahead of time what to expect and at what rate changes will occur. Peltier sensors and heat flow microcalorimetry (HFMC) allow for a determination if an environment is corrosive, the corrosion rate, and the predicted life of the test coupon. HFMC allows for service life predictions Abstract: opposed to the current salt flog testing which gives little meaningful data other than an item's condition after 48 hour exposure. The following study details how HFMC was able to determine the corrosive effects of several propellant formulations on gun barrel steel to aid in a product improvement plan. The HFMC analysis was coupled with standard chemical and metallurgical tests to validate the data.","Barrel; Corrosion; Microcalorimetry; Predictive analysis; Propellant","Barrel; Corrosive environment; Erosion corrosion; Flow microcalorimetry; Gun barrels; Harsh environment; Maintenance cost; Micro-calorimetry; Peltier; Predictive analysis; Product improvement; Service life prediction; U.S. Navy; Chemical analysis; Corrosion; Forecasting; Machinery; Propellants; Protective coatings; Service life; Systems engineering; Technology; Corrosion rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fassino, J.; Crane Division, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522, United States",,"Office of Naval Research;U.S. Army Research Laboratory;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;Naval Surface Warfare Center",,"59th Meeting of the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology: Essential Technologies for Successful Prognostics","18 April 2005 through 21 April 2005","Virginia Beach, VA",93705,,,,,"English","Essent.

We show for the first time that there is a wide distribution of SET pulse widths created by heavy ion radiation in digital CMOS logic at given linear energy transfer (LET) levels. We were able to measure SET pulse widths from as short as 344 ps to greater than 1.5 ns in 0.18 μm CMOS technology at LETs greater than 80 MeV-cm2/mg. Depending on LET, the cross section of the very long SET pulses were as much as four orders of magnitude smaller than for the shorter pulse widths. This has substantial implications for hardening techniques; specifically, we now know that we can dramatically improve the SET hardness without suffering the speed penalties required to remove the longest transients. © 2005 IEEE.","Error rate; Heavy ion; Radiation effects; Single event effects; Single event transient; Single event upset; Transient propagation; Transient pulse width","CMOS integrated circuits; Energy transfer; Heavy ions; Integrated circuit testing; Irradiation; Radiation effects; Error rate; Single event transient (set); Single event upset; Transient propagation; Transient pulse width; Laser pulses",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 8, 2005; revised August 26, 2005.

Moreover, its role in homeland security and force protection has expanded due, in part, to its good sensitivity, low power, lightweight, and reasonable cost. With the increased use of IMS systems as continuous monitors, it becomes necessary to develop tools and methodologies to ensure optimal performance over a wide range of conditions and extended periods of time. Namely, instrument calibration is needed to ensure proper sensitivity and to correct for matrix or environmental effects. We have developed methodologies to deal with the semi-quantitative nature of IMS and allow us to generate response curves that allow a gauge of instrument performance and maintenance requirements. This instrumentation communicates to the IMS systems via a software interface that was developed in-house. The software measures system response, logs information to a database, and generates the response curves. This paper will discuss the instrumentation, software, data collected, and initial results from fielded systems.","Chemical Warfare Agent Detection; Ion Mobility Spectroscopy","Calibration; Computer software; Explosives; Military operations; Preventive maintenance; Sensitivity analysis; Chemical Warfare Agent Detection; Instrument performance; Ion Mobility Spectroscopy; Software interface; Optimal systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eiceman, G.A., Karpas, Z., (1993) Ion Mobility Spectrometry, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl; Ingle Jr., J.D., Crouch, S.R., (1988) Spectrochemical Analysis, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; McKinley, J., Majors, R.E., (2000) LCGC, 18, pp. 1024-1033; Proctor, C.J., Todd, J.F.J., (1984) Anal.

The increase in payload capacity allows for new types of payloads to be carried and facilitates the option of carrying multiple payloads per mission. This added capability creates integration difficulties. Modifying the vehicle and ground station software with each new payload is unacceptable. Software integration, regression and safety concerns make the integration effort costly and lengthy. The Modular Mission Payload Architecture addressed these issues with a web-centric network-based solution that migrates the command and control interface of modular mission payloads from inside the ground control station and vehicle management systems to a separate controller in the vehicle. This migration and a common interface minimize modifications to system hardware and software to incorporate new payloads, thus reducing engineering development time, facilitating quicker integration at lower costs and allowing payload commonality across services and platforms.","Integration; Modular Mission Payload; Open Systems; Payloads; Unmanned Vehicles","Modular mission payload; Payloads; Unmanned platforms; Unmanned vehicle systems; Computer software; Control equipment; Costs; Flight dynamics; Integration; Open systems; Regression analysis; World Wide Web; Unmanned vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, C.; Crane Division, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522, United States","Gerhart G.R.Shoemaker C.M.Gage D.W.","SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering",,"Unmanned Ground Vehicle Technology VI","13 April 2004 through 15 April 2004","Orlando, FL",64059,0277786X,,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444281963

This paper explains how this has been done. The increased accuracy derives from detailed, three-dimensional CED computations including, solar heating, buoyancy, complete building geometry specification, trees, wind fluctuations, and particle and droplet distributions (as appropriate). This paper shows how a very finite number of such computations for a given area can be extended to all wind directions and speeds, and all likely sources and source locations using a new data structure called Dispersion Nomographs™. Finally, we demonstrate a portable, entirely graphical software tool called CT-Analyst that embodies this entirely new, high-resolution technology and runs effectively on small personal computers. Real-time users don't have to wait for results because accurate answers are available with near zero-latency (that is 10 - 20 scenarios per second). Entire sequences of cases (e.g. a continuously changing source location or wind direction) can be computed and displayed as continuous-action movies.

The device utilizes a novel Northrop Grumman cusp gun that provides a high quality axis-encircling electron beam. The axis-encircling beam from the cusp gun provides a significantly more efficient gyrotron interaction for harmonic operation than a non-axis-encircling beam from a magnetron injection gun (MIG) because the electrons are not constrained to a fixed azimuth so they rotate through both the peaks and nulls of the linearly polarized mode. An important advantage of harmonic gyro-TWTs is that they are capable of higher power than at the fundamental cyclotron harmonic because they are more stable to the absolute instability at cutoff of the operating mode. Due to weaker strength of the harmonic interactions, the start-oscillation current is significantly higher for higher harmonic operation. This allows higher harmonic gyro-TWTs to operate stably with appreciably higher beam current. The magnetic circuit is designed to provide both the magnetic field reversal required in the cusp gun region to produce the axis-encircling beam and at the same time a constant axial magnetic field of 5.48 kG in the interaction circuit region over the 42 cm length of the circuit. Recently the magnetic circuit was reoptimized to provide a better field profile match to the field profile required by the cusp gun in the field reversal region. In addition the axial magnetic field is designed to ensure that each section of the device is free from oscillation. The magnetic circuit consists of water cooled copper magnet coils and iron pole pieces.

The peniotron incorporates a four-vane slotted (magnetron-like) cavity operating in the fundamental waveguide mode, the π/2 mode. Interaction is at approximately 34 GHz with the second-harmonic beam mode. This interaction provides good separation from possible competing gyrotron modes. The cavity incorporates an output coupling iris which is required to achieve the desired loaded Q of 375 necessary for overcoupling of the device and optimum power output The predicted output power is approximately 125 kW (at 47% device efficiency as predicted with our large-signal code). Cold test of the cavity/iris combination shows good agreement with predictions from simulation with HFSS. The interaction is powered by a Northrop-Grumman cusp gun which provides the high quality axis-encircling electron beam required for efficient interaction. For the device to operate as predicted, the gun will supply 3.5 amps at 70 kV. The spent beam should be suitable for recovery with a single-stage depressed collector, raising the total device efficiency to 57%. Recently, the magnetics have been completely re-designed to improve beam quality and ensure proper and safe operation of the gun. The magnetics have been assembled and are currently undergoing test. The circuit and associated components have been fabricated and tested. Upon completion of the collector, the device will be assembled for test and preliminary results reported.

It is shown that the increase in base current is dominated by increased N it and the ""true"" low dose rate enhancement in the ELDRS parts occurs for zero and negative gate voltage, but is eliminated for large positive gate voltage and elevated temperature irradiation. Implications for ELDRS models are discussed.","Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS); P-glass/nitride","Bipolar transistors; Capacitors; Irradiation; Mathematical models; Oxides; Passivation; Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS); Gate voltages; Interface traps; Dosimeters",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA: 04-4021, N00164-02-D-6599; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA: DE-AC04-94AL85000","Manuscript received June 1, 2004; revised September 1, 2004.

The parts analyzed were all NP type gated diodes formed with the n-type emitter and p-type base of a standard linear bipolar process. Diodes, having either 7 or 14 μm gate widths, were exposed to ionizing radiation at dose rates of 17 and 0.017 rad(Si)/s with either 0 or 10 V gate biases. Characteristics at several doses were measured using a step stress approach. The majority of the experimental results are shown to be consistent with the space charge model for enhanced- low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS) in bipolar technologies. The results also show, as expected, that gate width has no influence on fixed oxide trapped charge buildup. However, the results suggest the need to refine the standard technique for extracting interface trap densities; where the area of the gate electrode is a critical parameter.","Bipolar transistor; Diodes; Dose rate; ELDRS; Gate sweep; Ionizing radiation; Radiation effects","Bipolar technologies; Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS); Gate sweep; Gated diodes; Bipolar transistors; Carrier concentration; Defects; Diodes; Electron traps; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Oxides; Radiation effects; Dosimetry",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received August 27, 2004.

This theory is based on the effects of ions in the electron gun. Some of these ions enter the gun from the interaction region of the TWT. Ions generated in the gun can also have a significant effect on the instabilities. The characteristics (in particular, the timing and shapes) of the waveforms of the instabilities are discussed in detail. The sawtooth waveform often observed is explained by the rates of ion generation in the beam and then the rapid discharge of ions into the gun. When gas pressure in the gun is elevated because of relatively high pressure in the TWT, cathode evaporation, or sputtering, the waveforms can take on a complex double exponential shape that sometimes has a double period. Some of the reasons for these effects are given. The effects that are observed of solenoid current, cathode voltage, RF drive level, and collector voltage on the instabilities are explained by the effects of these parameters on an ion barrier at the collector end of the TWT. When these quantities are such that the barrier is small, the drainage of beam ions to the collector is increased and to the gun is decreased. With reduced ion flow to the gun, gas generation in the gun is reduced, and so the causes of the instabilities are suppressed. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Electric currents; Electric potential; Electron beams; Electron guns; Ion beams; Solenoids; Spurious signal noise; Sputtering; AM noise; Collector voltage; Continuous wave coupled cavity; FM noise; Ion induced instabilities; Linear beam microwave tube; Phase noise; Traveling wave tubes",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Manuscript received August 29, 2003; revised January 30, 2004.

As device feature sizes shrink, digital circuits become faster, have smaller parasitics, and become more susceptible to single event effects (SEEs). If an ionizing particle creates enough charge to be collected on a node within a combinatorial gate, a transient pulse will be formed that may propagate through the circuit and be latched in as bad data. In order to predict the response of a circuit to a single event, people have long used circuit and device level simulations. In this paper, we show that when dealing with deep submicron technologies, knowing the pulse structure of the transient is crucial to predicting its propagation distance accurately. © 2004 IEEE.","Single Event Effects (SEEs); Single Event Transients (SETs)","High electron mobility transistors; Radiation hardening; Deep sub-micron technology; Digital single event transients; Ionizing particles; Modeling and verifications; Propagation distances; Pulse structures; Single event effects; Single event transients; Transients",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mavis, D.G., Eaton, P.H., Soft error rate mitigation techniques for modern microcircuits (2002) Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings, 2002. 40th Annual, pp. 216-22S; Massengill, L., SEU modeling and prediction techniques (1993) IEEE Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects Conference Short Course Text; Baze, M.P., Buchner, S.P., Attenuation of single event induced pulses in CMOS combinatorial logic (1997) IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 44 (6), pp. 2217-2223. , December",,,"IEEE Electron Devices Society;IEEE Reliability Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","42nd Annual IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium, IRPS 2004","25 April 2004 through 29 April 2004",,112336,15417026,,,,"English","IEEE Int.

These improvements are necessary due to an increasingly sophisticated and widely proliferated arsenal of infrared-guided Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and other surface-to-air and air-to-air missile threats. Some of these threats now have the potential to fall into the hands of various terrorist groups, posing a serious threat to both military and civilian aircraft. Highly energetic fuel additives, such as ultrafine aluminum (UFAL), have been incorporated into both conventional magnesium-Teflon-Viton (MTV) and spectrally balanced decoy flare compositions. The latter type of composition enables the flare to have a closer infrared spectral match to the target aircraft than does the conventional MTV composition. Nanoscale materials have increased in popularity in recent years. Their chief advantage in the present flare compositions is the increase in burn rate and infrared emission intensity caused by their greatly increased surface area, as compared with conventional micron-scale fuel ingredients. The efforts reported here were performed at laboratory scale and led to the characterization of a number of promising conventional and spectrally balanced UFAL-containing compositions. The dangerously high electrostatic sensitivity of UFAL and the compositions made from it complicated their scale-up to prototype size flare candles (150-200 gram form factors). However, pre-coating the UFAL ingredient with Viton binder has shown promise for mitigating these electrostatic sensitivity safety concerns.",,"Aircraft; Electrostatics; Infrared radiation; Magnesium compounds; Missiles; Nanostructured materials; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Radar countermeasures; Sensitivity analysis; Tracking (position); Flare compositions; Infrared countermeasures; Magnesium-teflon-viton (MTV); Ultrafine aluminum (UFAL); Aluminum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wilharm, C.K., Shortridge, R.G., Effect of binder loading and application on mixture homogeneity, ignition sensitivities, and burn times for pyrotechnic compositions with ALEX (2002) Proceedings of the 29th International Pyrotechnics Seminar, pp. 213-218. , International Pyrotechnic Seminars, U.S.A., Westminster, CO, 14-19 July; Dreitzler, D.R., Stephens, W.D., Exploded aluminum for propellants, (ALEX); an overview Proceedings of the 1993 JANNAF Propulsion Meeting, Held in Monterey, California, 15-19 Nov 1993, 5, pp. 483-487. , CPIA-PUB-602; Ivanov, G.V., Uniformity of burning and detonation of pyrotechnic mixtures base on activated aluminum Proceedings of the 1995 JANNAF Propulsion Meeting, Held in Tampa, Florida, 4-8 Dec 1995, 1, pp. 89-96. , CPIA-PUB-630; Chiaverini, M.J., Harting, G.C., Yeu-Cheung, L., Kuo, K.K., Peretz, A., Jones, S., Wygle, B., Arves, J.P., Pyrolysis behavior of hybrid rocket solid fuels under rapid heating conditions AIAA Conference Proceedings, July 1997, , AIAA-97-3078; Mench, M.M., Kuo, K.K., Lu, Y.-C., (1997) Characterization of Burning Rate, Temperature Sensitivity and Stability Behavior of AP=Based Composite Propellants and a Comparison of Thermal Behavior of Ultra-fine Aluminum Made from Plasma Explosion Process with Regular Aluminum Powders, , Final Report for Contract N00014-96-1-0785, September.

We find that exposure to 1 Mrad total dose at 77 K produces significantly less base current degradation than exposure at 300 K, and hence the total dose tolerance of SiGe HBTs, which is already excellent at room temperature without intentional hardening, improves with cooling. We compare 77 and 300 K radiation results in order to better understand the damage mechanisms.","Cryogenic temperatures; Gamma irradiation; Radiation; SiGe; SiGe heterohunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","Cooling; Cryogenics; Degradation; Dosimetry; Electric breakdown; Electric field effects; Gamma rays; Germanium; Optimization; Radiation damage; Silicon; Silicon wafers; Thermocouples; Carrier diffusivity; Cryogenic temperatures; Dose tolerance; SiGe; Heterojunction bipolar transistors",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA; Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA","Manuscript received July 26, 2003; revised August 20, 2003.

Simulations are performed on stripe-cell structures employing three different neck widths. A simple methodology is presented showing how these simulations can be used to approximate the drain and gate biases required to induce SEGR. These biases are then compared with the experimental data and found to be in good agreement. By means of simulations, we investigated the effects of various physical mechanisms and input parameters, which are likely to be important in SEGR and found that impact ionization plays a crucial role in the process. The simulations show that the N+ source and P+ plug are critical to the hardened design (narrower neck widths). Clearly, simulations could become a useful tool in evaluating certain design and processing variations.","DESSIS; Failure mechanism; Gate rupture; Heavy ion track; Impact ionization; ISE; MOSFETs; Physical mechanism; SEGR; Stripe cell; Three-dimensional; Two-dimensional","Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Failure analysis; Gates (transistor); Impact ionization; Ion implantation; Particle beam tracking; Radiation hardening; DESSIS; Heavy ion track; ISF; SEGR; Single event gate rupture (SEGR); Stripe cell; MOSFET devices",,,,,"Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 16, 2003; revised September 5, 2003.

Figure 1 shows the dispersion diagram for the Ka-band Cusp gun second-harmonicm TE (2)21 gyro-TWT amplifier [I] currently being developed at UC Davis. The dispersion diagram show tlie gazing intersection of the second-harmonic cyclotron resonance and the TE21 mode of the circular waveguide circuit which represents the mode of operation. The diagram also shows other potential oscillating modes. The modeselective circuit shown in Fig. 2 is employed in the device to destroy the odd-order Tem1 modes. The circuit is sliced with two orthogonal slices through the axis to interrupt the admuthal wall currents. Surrounding the interaction circuit is a lossy cylinder to absorb the Wated power. The remaining even-order modes are suppressed by adding msmbuted loss to the circuit. It would be desirable for ease of fabrication, cost and reliability to replace the sliced circuit with and smooth bore circular waveguide circuit. A smooth bore waveguide design is investigated and simulated performance characteristics are compared to the sliced circuit Ka-band Cusp gun second:harmonic TE(2)21 gyro-TWT amplifier design. In the proposed design the odd-order modes are suppressed by adding additional distributed loss to the circuit instead of by slicing. © 2003 IEEE.",,"Amplifiers (electronic); Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic dispersion; Gyroscopes; Harmonic analysis; Vacuum technology; Waveguides; Dispersion diagrams; Interaction circuits; Mode of operations; Orthogonal slices; Oscillating modes; Second harmonic cyclotron resonance; Simulated performance; Waveguide design; Traveling wave tubes",,,,,"F49620-99- 1-0297",,,,,,,,,,,"Harriet, S.B., McDermott, D.B., Gallagher, D.A., Luhmann, N.C., Jr., Cusp Gun TEzl Second-Harmonic KaBand Gyro-TWT ampllifid (2002) IEEE Twiimctions on Plusnzu Science, 30, pp. 909-914. , June",,,"IEEE Electron Devices Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference, IVEC 2003","28 May 2003 through 30 May 2003",,114315,,0780376994; 9780780376991,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The variation in Dit with total dose, however, is different for the passivated versus the unpassivated samples.

Both devices employ a sliced mode-selective circuit to suppress the odd-order azimuthal modes. The new device will avoid the loss in efficiency that is due to off-axis electrons interacting with the resulting linearly polarized mode. The amplifier is predicted by our large signal code to produce 50 kW in Ka-band with 20% efficiency, 30 dB saturated gain, and 3% bandwidth. The 70-kV 3.5-A axis-encircling electron beam with v⊥/vz = 1.2 and Δvz/vz = 7% will be produced by a Cusp electron gun delivered by Northrop Grumman. The amplifier has been designed using linear theory to provide a 30% safety margin from absolute instability. Distributed loss is added to the first 30.5 cm of the circuit to ensure the device is stable to harmonic gyro-BWO. The last 11.5 cm of the circuit is standard copper to avoid attenuating the wave at high power levels.","Axis-encircling electron beam; Cusp gun; Gyro-traveling-wave tube (gyro-TWT); Gyro-TWT amplifier; Millimeter-wave amplifier; Mode-selective circuit; Second-harmonic","Amplifiers (electronic); Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Electron beams; Electron guns; Millimeter wave devices; Traveling wave tubes; Magnetron injection guns (MIG); Gyrotrons",,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR: F49620-99-1-0297; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI","Manuscript received April 12, 2001; revised April 4, 2002.

The goal is to estimate service life (SL), the age at which these batteries must be replaced. QET data is obtained by sampling a few dozen units of various ages throughout the range of date of manufacturing (DOM) of the inventory. It is expensive to obtain; few data points are available. Typically, a QET is performed every 3-5 years on 22 samples. Abundant lot acceptance test (LAT) data usually is available; it is used to perform lot sentencing (accept or reject) before shipping. Here, the authors show new mathematical methods which improve the accuracy of service life estimation, and which also may be a significant advance in the general mathematical theory of regression analysis. The enhanced delta method also eliminates the well-known problem that arises when QET and LAT raw data sets are combined in one analysis. © 2002 IEEE.","Aging; Batteries; Cranes; Life estimation; Manufacturing; Missiles; Performance evaluation; Runtime; Sampling methods; Testing","Aging of materials; Cranes; Electric batteries; Estimation; Fleet operations; Manufacture; Missiles; Naval vessels; Quality control; Regression analysis; Solar cells; Testing; Critical performance parameters; Life estimation; Mathematical method; Performance evaluation; Runtimes; Sampling method; Service life estimation; Variance reductions; Acceptance tests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Applied Linear Statistical Models, , 3rd Ed, by Neter, Wasserman &amp; Kutner, ©1990 RD Irwin; Lander, Sowder, Shelf Life Degradation Study of a Reserve Zinc-Silver Oxide Battery, , AFWAL WPAFB","Freeland, J.; NAVSEA Crane Division, Building 3235, United States; email: freeland_john@crane.nav.mil",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","17th Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances","15 January 2002 through 18 January 2002",,115776,,0780371321,PBAAE,,"English","Proc Annu Battery Conf Appl Adv",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948649351

Wavelet transforms have been applied to IMS spectra in order to de-noise and enhance spectral features. Next, trigger metrics of the spectra were derived using a statistical evaluator (SE) and optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). The combination of wavelets, SE, and GA has been demonstrated to differentiate between background, analyte, interferent, and a binary mixture of analyte and interferent. This results in an overall increase in resolving power. The new system is less sensitive to false positives due to increased selectivity, shows the ability to yield quantitative data at ultra-low concentrations for low level toxicity, has the ability to detect binary mixtures of compounds, and shows great potential in significantly improving chemical warfare detection capabilities under field conditions. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.","Chemical detection; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithm; Ion mobility; Neural networks; Signal processing; Statistical evaluator","Agents; Binary mixtures; Chemical warfare; Fuzzy sets; Genetic algorithms; Ionization; Molecular weight; Neural networks; Optimization; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Chemical detection; Ion mobility; Ion mobility spectrometer; Ion mobility spectroscopy; Specificity; Statistical evaluator; Ions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eiceman, G.A., Karpas, Z., (1993) Ion Mobility Spectrometry, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl; Daubechies, I., Orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets (1988) Comm.

Cell-free extracts of this culture are capable of reducing TNT, utilizing either nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or nicrotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as co-factors.

VEM utilizes finite difference techniques in conductive, dielectric, and magnetic environments. The VEM code, written in MATLAB for Windows 95/98, provides an inexpensive, user-friendly graphical interface that is platform independent. VEM consists of a structure window in which the user enters electromagnetic materials and sources via common drawing tools and pop-up menus. The solver button generates the system matrix, solves it, and activates the solutions window in which the results are displayed in a variety of user-selected viewing modes. Though the solution region is finite in extent, a compact simulation of the open boundaries of infinite extent is achieved via the Transparent Grid Termination (TGT). Preliminary evaluations of the enhancement of student learning by VEM are promising. A full demonstration of VEM will be included in the presentation.",,"Learning tools; Visual electromagnetics (VEM); Computer hardware; Computer software; Curricula; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetism; Learning systems; Mathematical techniques; Students; User interfaces; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Voltmer, D., Undergraduate electromagnetics: Discrete, numeric, and continuous (2000) Proceedings of Progress in Electromagnetic Research, , Cambridge, MA, July; http://www.vectorfields.com/op2d.htm; http://www.quickfield.com/; http://www.sonnetusa.com/lite/index.htm; http://www.ansoft.com/products/em/max2d/max2d_brochure.html; http://www.infolvtica.qc.ca/products/gemini/; Manke Jr., R.P., (1992) EMAG: A 2-D Electrostatic and Magnetostatic Solver in MATLAB, , M.S.

Diodes were fabricated with a wide range of barrier heights (1.06-1.60 eV) and were evaluated after being exposed to a 60Co gamma radiation source. DC current-voltage characteristics were measured after several radiation doses, with no observable degradation in the diode forward or reverse characteristics up to a total dose of 4 Mrad(Si). Measured breakdown voltages of postirradiated diodes increase approximately 200 V compared to the virgin devices and are attributed to increased negative interface charge, as determined by MOS capacitor measurements and correlated with numerical breakdown simulations.","Diodes; Gamma radiation; Schottky barrier; Silicon carbide (SiC)","Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Current voltage characteristics; Electric breakdown; Gamma rays; MOS capacitors; Power supply circuits; Radiation effects; Silicon carbide; Gamma irradiation; Schottky barrier diodes",,,,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NCC5-459; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA; Auburn University, AU; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Manuscript received July 17, 2001.

Other testing on the actual membranes is generating data for both cellulosic and polypropylene materials on impedance, swelling properties, and silver and zinc penetration rates.

Constant and varying depoling voltages around the coercive field are applied along the c-axis during and after holographic recording in the crystal. The holographic grating is written with two mutually coherent, ordinarily polarized Argon beams at 514 nm. The diffraction efficiency is monitored with an extraordinarily polarized, low power He-Ne beam. The writing beams are expanded to fill the crystal to improve the stability of the reversed domains. The diffraction efficiency in the recording stage is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of a grating written without an external field.

To achieve polarization independence, four holographic gratings are superimposed in the crystal, two per wavelength, in order to satisfy the Bragg condition for both polarization-modes of the birefringent LiNbOs. Theoretical studies investigating the feasibility of matched diffraction efficiencies for each polarization component are presented. The gratings are written in transmission geometry with the 514 nm line of an Argon-ion laser; the infrared readout is carried out in reflection geometry. Thermal fixing is used to achieve non-destructive readout, and the results of several modified fixing procedures are compared. Preliminary experimental results with a HeNe readout beam in transmission geometry are discussed. Fixed diffraction efficiencies of about 50% per channel for the superposition of 4 gratings in a 0.05 wt.% iron-doped LiNbO3 crystal are achieved.

These gratings divide a single input beam into two beams that interfere in the far-field. The diffraction efficiency of the gratings depends on the angle between the grating vector and the c-axis, the full angle between the writing beams and their intensity ratio. A PZT-driven mirror phase modulates one of the writing beams that result in a beam modulation rate of up to 700 Hz. This demonstrates the feasibility of a photorefractive crystal as a laser beam modulator. Laser beam modulation is also carried out in LiNbO3 crystal. Two physical geometries have been considered with this crystal. We record only two gratings to form an interferometric path. In this case, applying an external ac electric field to the crystal along the path of one arm of the interferometer results in the desired modulated output.

The excellent phase noise capability of SiGe HBTs is retained after 1 Mrad(Si) irradiation. The observed radiation hardness is attributed to the minor changes in the low frequency noise and device nonlinearities after irradiations, as well as the nonlinearity cancellation mechanism. The radiation-induced defects do not significantly add to the low frequency noise in these SiGe HBTs, even though they produce a large space-charge-region recombination component in the base current. The inherent excellent linearity of these SiGe HBTs makes the up-conversion from device low frequency noise to phase noise inefficient, and helps to retain the low phase noise after irradiations.",,"Chemical vapor deposition; Electric space charge; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Nonlinear optics; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Spurious signal noise; Gamma irradiations; Nonlinearity-cancellation methods; Radiation-induced defects; Heterojunction bipolar transistors",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center","This work was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN, under contract no.

The light propagating in one direction is orthogonally linearly polarized to the oppositely propagating light. The orthogonal polarization is implemented by a non-reciprocal optical element. The optical carder is attenuated by appropriately setting the Mach-Zender Modulator (MZM) at quadrature bias point.

We propose an optical method for determining the value of the coercive field in ferroelectric crystals. An interferometric method is used to map the change in the index of refraction with negative applied fields, where the minimum of the index change is an indication of the coercive field. From this experiment, values of 1.55 kV ± 20 V for the coercive voltage and 147 ± 6 pm/V for the linear electro-optic coefficient are found. Two electrical-fixing techniques that result in very high diffraction efficiencies are presented, discussed and compared to previous publications on electrical fixing in SBN. High diffraction efficiencies of about 95% were achieved with the application of negative fields near the coercive region, during and after holographic recording in the crystal.",,"Coercive force; Crystals; Diffraction; Electric potential; Electrooptical effects; Holography; Interferometry; Optical phase conjugation; Photorefractive materials; Refraction; Electrical fixing; Ferroelectric materials",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wilde, J.P., Hesselnik, L., (1992) Opt.

Simulations show this variability may be a natural consequence of the low base doping of the substrate PNP (SPNP) input transistors. Low base doping increases the SPNPs collector to base breakdown voltage, current gain, and densities. The build-up of oxide trapped charge (N OT) and interface traps (N IT) is shown to be a function of pre-irradiation bakes. Experimental data indicate that, despite its structural similarities to the LM111, irradiated input transistors of the LM124 operational amplifier do not exhibit the same sensitivity to variations in pre-irradiation thermal cycles. Further disparities in LM111 and LM124 responses may result from a difference in the oxide defect build-up in the two part types. Variations in processing, packaging, and circuit effects are suggested as potential explanations.",,"Current gain; Linear bipolar microcircuits; Substrate input transistors; Total dose response; Bipolar integrated circuits; Bipolar transistors; Comparator circuits; Composition effects; Degradation; Dosimetry; Electric breakdown; Electric current collection; Irradiation; Semiconductor device structures; Semiconductor doping; Thermal cycling; Radiation effects",,,,,"DE-AC04-94AL85000; Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA","Manuscript received July 25, 2000.

Surf. Warfare Ctr.-Crane Div., Crane, IN 47522, United States","High-density microelectronics increasingly requires advanced cooling strategies to ensure reliable, high performance. The use of substrates with high thermal conductivity, e.g., diamond, is an attractive approach to managing heat dissipation; however, the fabrication of metal circuitry on diamond films is hindered by the chemical inertness of the surface. In this paper, we present an additive, channel constrained metallization process for the fabrication of metal circuitry on diamond surfaces. We address several issues specific to this application, including photoresist lithography and metal adhesion on substrates with significant surface roughness (peak-to-valley roughness approximately 4 to 5 μm) and the fabrication of circuitry with sufficient electrical conductivity. Fabricated circuitry exhibits suitable resolution (approximately 10 μm), metal thickness (≥2 μm), effective electrical resistivity (approximately 10 μΩ-cm for composite Ni/Cu/Au traces), and adhesion (passes tape peel test) for operation at power levels of at least 22 W (i.e., 1 A, 22 V) without failure or delamination. Thermal modeling and IR images of operating circuitry show an approximately 50% decrease in component junction temperature rise (from ambient) on diamond (k to approximately 1200 W/m K) vs. alumina (k to approximately 20 W/m K), consistent with thermal conductivity differences between these substrate materials.",,"Adhesion; Alumina; Electric conductivity of solids; Metallizing; Photoresists; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconducting diamonds; Subscription television; Surface roughness; Channel constrained metallization (CCM); Microelectronic processing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altoz, F.E., (1997) Electronic Packaging and Interconnection Handbook, , C.

Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment has been used to develop and implement technologies to meet the growing analysis and maintenance needs of secondary batteries. One highlight of the capabilities developed under this program, is a technique for electrochemically measuring the state of charge (SOC) of silver-zinc (Ag-Zn) batteries. This paper presents the developed technique and outlines a three-stage test procedure for determining SOC. The technique takes a minimal amount of time and provides results of high accuracy. This development meets a longstanding need for the immediate verification of Ag-Zn battery readiness. © 1999 IEEE.","Battery charge measurement; Charge measurement; Circuits; Cranes; Current measurement; Data acquisition; Space technology; System testing; Temperature measurement; Voltage","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Cranes; Data acquisition; Electric batteries; Electric current measurement; Electric potential; Lead acid batteries; Networks (circuits); Silver; Technology transfer; Temperature measurement; Testing; Zinc; Battery charge measurement; Charge measurements; Commercial off the shelf equipments; New technology development; Space technologies; State-of-charge measurements; System testing; Test procedures; Secondary batteries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics;Independent Battery Manufacturers Association Inc.;International Battery Technology Inc.;Southern California Edison Company;The Electrochemical Society, Inc.;The International Cadmium Association (North America)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15th Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances","11 January 2000 through 14 January 2000",,116670,,0780359240,PBAAE,,"English","Proc Annu Battery Conf Appl Adv",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949682135

The first VRLA aircraft batteries were cylindrical cell design and evolved to a prismatic design to save weight, volume, and to increase rate capability. This paper discusses the next generation of the VRLA aircraft battery. The HORIZON composite grid VRLA design reduces weight, increases high rate performance, and is expected to increase service life. This paper discusses the weight reduction over the present 30 ah prismatic VRLA aircraft battery design; improvements in high rate engine start performance, and presents the status of the development effort. Finally, the paper discusses the applications for the 30 Ah composite grid VRLA aircraft battery, and shows the future application opportunities for light weight VRLA both in the military and commercially. © 1999 IEEE.","Aircraft propulsion; Batteries; Corrosion; Costs; Cranes; Engines; Military aircraft; Production; Qualifications; Valves","Aircraft engines; Aircraft propulsion; Corrosion; Costs; Cranes; Design; Electric batteries; Engines; Military aircraft; Military applications; Production; Solar cells; Valves (mechanical); Cylindrical cells; Future applications; High reliability; High-rate performance; Qualifications; Rate capabilities; United States Navy; Valve regulated lead acid batteries; Lead acid batteries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Senderak, K.L., Goodman, A.W., (1981) AProceedings of the 16th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference@, 1, pp. 117-122. , August; Senderak, K., Beard, K., (1983) AProceedings of the 30th Power Sources Symposium@, pp. 87-89. , The Electrochemical Society, Inc; Vutetakis, D.G., Johnson, W.R., A Maintenance Free Lead Acid Battery for Inertial Navigation Systems in Aircraft (1995) IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, , May (Battelle) Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division; Koss, S., Rice, D., Goodman, A., Johnson, W.R., Sealed Lead-Acid Battery Performance and Present Aircraft Applications (1999) SAE Aerospace Power Systems Conference, , P-307, Williamsburg, Va. 9-11 April (Concorde Battery Corporation) (Hawker Energy Products) (Naval Surface Warfare Center - Crane Division) (Naval Air Systems Command)",,,"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics;Independent Battery Manufacturers Association Inc.;International Battery Technology Inc.;Southern California Edison Company;The Electrochemical Society, Inc.;The International Cadmium Association (North America)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15th Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances","11 January 2000 through 14 January 2000",,116670,,0780359240,PBAAE,,"English","Proc Annu Battery Conf Appl Adv",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949658766

After its deployment, the electrical responses of several bipolar transistors and linear circuits have been and continue to be recorded once during every 12-hour orbit. System dosimeters are monitored to establish an average accumulated dose per orbit. With this information, the electrical parameter data are correlated with the dosimetry data to determine the total dose response of each device. This paper updates information on the ELDRS experiment through May 14, 1999. As of this date, the experiment has been in flight for a period of 18 months and has accumulated an approximate dose of 18 krd(Si), For comparison, devices, specifically linear circuits with the same date code, were irradiated using Co-60 sources, herein defined as ground-based tests. The ground-based tests are used to evaluate two hardness assurance tests, a room temperature irradiation at 10 mrd(Si)/s and an elevated temperature irradiation at 100°C and 10 rd(Si)/s and to evaluate the ELDRS response. To that end, irradiations were performed at room temperature, approximately 22 °C, at fixed dose rates of 100, 1, and 0.01 rd(Si)/s and at elevated temperature, approximately 100°C, at a fixed dose rate of 10 rd(Si)/s. Currently, irradiations are being performed at room temperature at a fixed dose rate of 0.001 rd(Si)/s. Comparing the ground-based data to the flight data clearly demonstrates that enhanced parametric degradation has occurred in the flight parts. The two hardness assurance screens predicted ELDRS but the design margin for the elevated . temperature test may not be adequate.",,"Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity; Ground based tests; Bipolar transistors; Dosimeters; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Linear integrated circuits; Radiation hardening; Space applications; Temperature; Radiation effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nowlin, R.N., E.

Failures are studied using normalized Monte Carlo simulations validated by statistical methods. These validated Monte Carlo simulations are then used to extract and present an extracted expression. The concept of a lethal ion rate is discussed. Single event gate rupture (SEGR) failure thresholds at different ion impact angles are measured and reported on the Harris FSL11AO and FRL11AO (radiation-hardened vertical MOSFETs having similar layouts but with different SEGR sensitivities). Integral flux curves are presented for various orbits and conditions.

The single event gate rupture response was experimentally determined using mono-energetic ion beams of copper, niobium, and gold. Irradiations were conducted using an ion species tuned to different energies, producing a range of linear energy transfer (LET) values for that ion. Numerous MOSFETs were characterized to identify the onset of ioninduced dielectric breakdown. These data along with previously taken data demonstrated that the ion-induced dielectric breakdown cannot be adequately described in terms of LET, but is better described in terms of atomic number (Z). Based upon these observations, a new semi-empirical expression is presented describing the critical inn-induced breakdown response in terms of Z instead of LET. This expression is shown to be a better single evenl gate rupture model of the capacitor response. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Copper; Dielectric properties of solids; Electric breakdown of solids; Energy transfer; Gold; Ion beams; Ion bombardment; Niobium; Power electronics; Semiconductor device models; Atomic numbers; Ion energy; Linear energy transfer (LET); Single-event gate rupture (SEGR); MOSFET devices",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wrobel, T.F., On Heavy-Ion Induced Hard Errors in Dielectric Structures, , IEEE Trans.

The circuits include primarily operational amplifiers and voltage comparators with a variety of sensitive components and failure modes. The proposed method, presented in 1997, includes an option between a low dose rate test at 10mrd(Si)/s and room temperature and a 100°C elevated temperature irradiation test at a moderate dose rate. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that a 10 mrd(Si)/s test is able (in all but one case) to bound the worst case response within a factor of 2. For the moderate dose rate, 100°C test the worst case response is within a factor of 3 for 8 of 11 circuits, and for some circuits averpredicts the low dose rate response. The irradiation bias used for these tests often represents a more degrading bias condition than would be encountered in a typical space system application. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Bipolar integrated circuits; Comparator circuits; Integrated circuit testing; Irradiation; Operational amplifiers; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS); Radiation hardness; Linear integrated circuits",,,,,,"This work was sponsored by the Defense Special Weapons Agency.

Power MOSFETs from five variants were fabricated with nominal gate oxide thicknesses of 30, 50, 70, 100, and 150 nm. Devices from each variant were characterized to several heavy ion beams as previously reported; and then other devices from each variant were subsequently characterized to 200-MeV protons, as reported here. In addition, a limited characterization was performed using 44-MeV protons. Employing a similar test methodology, failure thresholds for the onset of proton-induced dielectric breakdown were determined for each gate oxide variant. The measured proton-induced dielectric breakdown thresholds induced by 200- and 44-MeV protons are compared to the measured heavy-ion induced failure thresholds. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Electric breakdown of solids; Failure analysis; Proton irradiation; Radiation damage; Semiconductor device manufacture; Proton induced dielectric breakdown; MOSFET devices",,,,,,"’ This work sponsored in part by Defense Special Weapons Agency.",,,,,,,,,,"Nichols, D.K., J.

Bias studies have shown that at high current densities, HBT base-emitter junctions degrade resulting in regions that exhibit non-radiative recombination. Defects in the epitaxial material can lead to current driven dislocation propagation caused by recombination enhanced dislocation climb and recombination enhanced dislocation glide. At current densities on the order of 100 KA/cm2, formation of dark-line defects occurs within 92 hours. At current densities approaching 150 KA/cm2, rapid changes (within hours) are observed in the EL pattern; however, little change in the dc and RF characteristics are seen in the short term. This demonstrates that the EL technique is a sensitive indicator of material changes in devices well before any electrical manifestation. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Aluminum gallium arsenide; Current density; Defects; Electroluminescence; Gallium arsenide; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; III-V semiconductors; Semiconducting gallium; Semiconductor alloys; Base emitter junction; DC and RF characteristics; Dislocation climb; Dislocation propagation; Epitaxial materials; High current densities; Non-radiative recombinations; Sensitive indicator; Aluminum alloys",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zipfel, C.L., Reliability of dh gal.,al,as leds for lightwave communications (1981) 19th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics, pp. 124-129. , April; Henderson, T., Electroluminescence: An essential technique for characterization of hbts (1996) GaAs REL Workshop, pp. 28-32; Ali, F., Gupta, A., Ggins, A., Advances in gaas power HBT mmics for rf microwave and mdlimeter wave applications' (1996) IEEE 1996 Microwave and Millimeter Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium, pp. 61-66. , June; Fukuda, M., (1991) Reliability and Degradation of Semiconductor Lasers and LEDs, , Artech House, Nonvood, MA",,,"JEDEC Committee JC-14.7 on GaAs Reliability and Quality Standards","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1998 GaAs Reliability Workshop, GAASRW 1998","1 November 1998",,134785,,0790800659; 9780790800653,,,"English","GaAs Reliab.

These data are then related to cycle-and wet-life information from model electrochemical cells as a function of separator composition on an alkaline chemistry rechargeable cell set. The first examples used in this program are silver-zinc rechargeable cells of 28 Ah capacity, identical in every respect except for the separator composition, which are being tested in statistically significant numbers under identical temperature and relative humidity conditions, with 45% KOH as the electrolyte. The cycle-life test regime of continuous cycling is: C/5 discharge to 1.30 V, and C/30 and C/60 charge to 2.03 V, while the wet-life test regime includes a 30-day wet-stand at full charge between cycles. At the outset of the cell testing, a baseline cell was selected from each set in the matrix after the so-called formation cycling was complete, and the physical properties of crystallinity, tensile strength, and degree of polymerization were re-measured. Then, at intervals during cycle-and wet-life cycling, and as cells fail the life tests, these properties will be measured again for selected cells. In this way a correlation will be established between separator life under charge/discharge conditions in actual cells and the critical physical properties of each separator film. Eight separator compositions, all cellulose-based, are being evaluated. The purpose of the study is to utilize the cycle-and wet-life data which are a function of separator composition and physical properties in the alkaline chemistry rechargeable cell set, to designate a 'best' separator for incorporation into actual production cells by the manufacturing community for silver/zinc rechargeable cells. The recommendations will take the form of minimum separator physical properties which are beneficial to cell performance and long life, resulting in an improvement in the assets available for Fleet use in the US Navy. This paper discusses the data available to date on cycle-and wet-life, and their relationship to separator physical properties before and at several stages during cycling.","Alkaline rechargeable cells; Cellulosic separators; Separators",,,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR; Naval Undersea Warfare Center, NUWC","This work was generously supported by the StandardHard-ware Acquisition and Reliability Program at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN; the Office of Naval Research, Washington, DC; the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Key-port, WA; and NASA-Lewis, Cleveland, OH.

Results at 300K indicate that this SiGe technology is robust with respect to neutron radiation. At fluences as high as 1015 n/cm2 (1.0 MeV equivalent) the devices exhibited a degradation of less than 30% in peak current gain. The SiGe HBTs maintain a current gain of 60 after 1015 n/cm2 at 84K, compared to the Si BJT which degrades with cooling to a current gain of 20 at 84K. The cutoff frequencies of both the Si and SiGe transistors are unaffected by neutron irradiation, and only a slight degradation in the maximum oscillation frequency of the transistors was observed. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Bipolar integrated circuits; Chemical vapor deposition; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric currents; Neutron irradiation; Oscillations; Radiation damage; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Vacuum applications; Neutron radiation tolerance; Ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD); Heterojunction bipolar transistors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cressler, J.D., Re-engineering Silicon: SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Technology, , IEEE Spectrum, pp. 49-55, March 1995; Cressler, J.D., Status and Trends in the Cryogenic Operation of SiGe Bipolar Technology, , Electrochemical Society Proceedings, vol. 95-9, pp. 159-177, 1995; Ohyama, H., Vanhellemont, J., Takami, Y., Sunaga, H., Poortmans, J., Caymax, M., Degradation of Si1-xGex Epitaxial Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors by 1-MeV Fast Neutrons, , IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 42, pp. 1550-1557, 1995; Cressler, J.D., Prospects for the Cryogenic Operation of Silicon-Germanium Technology, , Electrochemical Society Proceedings, vol. 97-2, pp. 215-231, 1997; Cressler, J.D., E.F.

These techniques remove the effect of linear and non-linear measurement equipment distortions in software. The vector demodulator (VDM) is the largest source of these linear and non-linear distortions. Data distortion also originates because of electromagnetic interference from the wall voltage. A description of the measurement equipment required for accurate SNR and phase measurements will be given. A non-standard piece of equipment required in this technique is an electronic phase shifter. The use of this electronic phase shifter allows the linear and non-linear VDM distortions to be characterized by sweeping the VDM through several different operating points. Details of the software algorithms for measuring SNR and phase will be discussed. The non-linear data analysis algorithm estimates SNR values in two steps: [1] Estimating the distortion levels by making a Fourier Transform of pulse-averaged I/Q values and [2] calculating an SNR value from amplitude and phase noise fluctuations derived from the measured VQ values by using a small-signal espansion of the noise fluctuations about the non-linear VDM operating points. Phase measurements are also corrupted due to the presence of VDM distortions. We will introduce phase measurement techques that minimize the effects of these distortions. The presence of line voltage interference is detectable from the Fourier analysis of collected data. Experiments have indicated a detectable level of contamination at frequencies of 60 Hz, 120 Hz: and 180 Hz. © 48th ARFTG Conference, ARFTG 1996 Digest - Fall 1996: RF Non-Linearitv Measurements, ARFTG 1996.

Three components of drain current resulting from the charge pumping measurement are identified. When the device is properly biased, charge pumping current can be separated from the other components of drain current and modeled over a wide range of interface trap densities using standard charge pumping theory.

The elastic structural model consists of 3-D beam elements used to approximate the global race deflection and non-linear springs that approximate the combined rolling element/raceway contact deflections. For rollers, an upperbound on the contact stress (assuming linear variation of force along the length of the roller) is estimated by modeling the rollers as pairs of nonlinear springs. The finite element approach iteratively solves the contact forces at each, rolling element. Contact stresses are then calculated from the contact, forces using Hertz contact theory. This approach is applied to analyze two proposed designs of ball and crossed roller bearing, bullgear assemblies used for rotating the radar antenna on top of a ship's mast. The loads analyzed include those arising from wind loading and from out-of-flatness of the inner race of the bearings due to deflection of the mast. The distribution of the load and the maximum contact stresses for the proposed bullgear assemblies are estimated and compared. It is found that the maximum contact stress in the crossed roller bearing is less than that in the ball bearing for both types of loads. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the out-of-flatness loading produces significantly higher stresses than wind loading. © 1996 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Contact mechanics; Rolling-element bearings; Stress analysis","Ball bearings; Calculations; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Mathematical models; Stress analysis; Three dimensional; Wind stress; Numerical methods; Roller bearings; Bullgears; Contact mechanics; Contact stresses; Crossed roller bearings; Global race deflection; Hertz contact theory; Rolling element bearings; Roller bearings; Bearings (machine parts); Bearing cage; Contact stress; Load distribution; Rolling bearing; Bullgears; Finite Element Method; Gears; Rollers",,,,,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","'This work was conducted under contract #N0016494M-6264 of thc Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center and the ;iuthors arc gratcfiil for permission to publish this work.

In this work, several hardness-assurance approaches are examined and compared to experimental results obtained at low dose rates. The approaches considered include irradiation at high dose rates while at elevated temperature and high-dose-rate irradiation followed by annealing. The lateral PNP transistors continue to degrade during post-irradiation annealing, in sharp contrast to NPN devices studied previously. High-temperature conditions significantly increase the degradation during high-dose-rate irradiation, with the amount of degradation continuing to increase with temperature throughout the range studied here (up to 125°C). The high-temperature degradation is nearly as great as that observed at very low dose rates, and is even greater when differences between 60Co and x-ray irradiation are accounted for. Since high-temperature irradiation has previously been shown to enhance the degradation in NPN transistors, this appears to be a promising hardness-assurance approach for bipolar integrated circuits. Based on these results, preliminary testing recommendations are discussed. © 1995 IEEE",,"Annealing; Degradation; Dosimetry; Radiation hardening; Semiconductor junctions; Thermal effects; Bipolar junction transistors; Dose rate dependence; Gain degradation; Bipolar transistors",,,,,"Mauritius Research Council, MRC","* This work was supported in part by the Defense Nuclear Agency, NSWC-Crane, MRC, and the US Department of Energy.",,,,,,,,,,"McClure, S., Pease, R.L., Will, W., Perry, G., Dependence of Total Dose Response of Bipolar Linear Microcircuits on Applied Dose Rate (1994) IEEE Trans.

The impact of gate oxide thickness on SEGR is experimentally determined from vertical power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) having identical process and design parameters, except for the gate oxide thickness. Power MOSFETs from five variants were specially fabricated with nominal gate oxide thicknesses of 30, 50, 70, 100, and 150 nm. Devices from each variant were characterized to mono-energetic ion beams of Nickel, Bromine, Iodine, and Gold. Employing different bias conditions, failure thresholds for the onset of SEGR were determined for each oxide thickness. Applying these experimental test results, the previously published empirical expression [1] is extended to include the effects of gate oxide thickness. In addition, observations of ion angle, temperature, cell geometry, channel conductivity, and curvature at high drain voltages are briefly discussed. © 1995 IEEE",,"Computational methods; Electric breakdown of solids; Failure (mechanical); Gates (transistor); Mathematical models; Oxides; Radiation effects; Gate oxide thickness; Single event gate rupture (SEGR); Threshold voltage; MOSFET devices",,,,,,"'This work is supported in part by Defense Nuclear Agency and United States Army Missile and Space Technology Command.",,,,,,,,,,"Wheatley, C.F., Titus, J.L., Burton, D.I., Single-Event Gate Rupture in Vertical Power MOSFETs; An Original Empirical Expression (1994) IEEE Trans.

The dose-rate dependence of current gain degradation in lateral PNP BJTs is even stronger than the dependence previously reported for NPN BJTs. Various mechanisms are presented and their relative significance for gain degradation in the lateral, substrate, and vertical PNPs is discussed. A detailed comparison of the lateral and substrate PNP devices is given. The specific lateral and substrate devices considered here are fabricated in the same process and possess identical emitters. Even though these devices have identical emitters and undergo the same processing steps, the lateral devices degrade significantly more than the substrate devices. © 1995 IEEE",,"Failure (mechanical); Integrated circuit testing; Radiation effects; Substrates; Bipolar junction transistors; Gain degradation; Bipolar transistors",,,,,"Sandia National Laboratories","This work was supported by DNA, NSWC-Crane, the Dept. of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories through Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Although both types of stress lead to qualitatively similar changes in the current gain of the device, the physical mechanisms responsible for the degradation are quite different. In the case of hot-carrier stress the damage is localized near the emitter-base junction, which causes the excess base current to have an ideality factor of two. For ionizing radiation stress, the damage occurs along all oxide-silicon interfaces, which causes the excess base current to have an ideality factor between one and two for low total doses of ionizing radiation, but an ideality factor of two for large total doses. The different physical mechanisms that apply for each type of stress imply that improvement in resistance to one type of stress does not necessarily imply improvement in resistance to the other type of stress. Based on the physical model, implications for correlating and comparing hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced damage are discussed. © 1995 IEEE",,"Current voltage characteristics; Gates (transistor); Hot carriers; Ionization of solids; Radiation effects; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor junctions; Stresses; Bipolar junction transistors; Hot carrier induced degradation; Ionizing radiation induced degradation; Bipolar transistors",,,,,"DE-AC04-94AL85000; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Manuscript received February 15, 1994; revised July 5, 1994.

In this regime, the excess base current depends on the particular charge-trapping properties of the oxide that covers the emitter base junction. The device response is dose-rate-, irradiation-bias-, and technology-dependent in this regime. However, once a critical amount of charge has accumulated in the oxide, the excess base current saturates at a value that is independent of how the charge accumulated. This saturated excess base current depends on the device layout, bulk lifetime in the base region, and the measurement bias. In addition to providing important insight into the physics of bipolar-transistor total-dose response, these results have significant circuit-level implications. For example, in some circuits, the transistor gain that corresponds to the saturated excess base current is sufficient to allow reliable circuit operation. For cases in which the saturated value of current gain is acceptable, and where other circuit elements permit such over-testing, this can greatly simplify hardness assurance for space applications. © 1994 IEEE",,"Charge carriers; CMOS integrated circuits; Computational methods; Electric current control; Electric currents; Gain control; Junction gate field effect transistors; Oxides; Radiation effects; Semiconductor junctions; Base current; Bipolar junction transistors; Charge trapping; Emitter base junction; Bipolar transistors",,,,,"Medical Research Council, MRC","+tThis work was supported by the Defense Nuclear Agency, Sandia National Laboratories, and Naval Surface Warfare Center-Crane.","This work was supported by Sandia National Labs through their BMDO electronics MODIL program and by DNA and NSWC-Crane through a contract with MRC.

For 0-V irradiation at ~ 25°C, the net trapped-positive-charge density (Nox) inferred from midgap C-V shifts is ~ 25-40% greater for low-dose-rate « 10 rad(SiO2)/S) than for high-dose-rate (> 100 rad(SiO2)/S) exposure. Device modeling shows that such a difference in screen-oxide Nox is enough to account for the enhanced low-rate gain degradation often observed in bipolar devices., due to the 2 ~exp(Nox) dependence of the excess base current. At the higher rates, TSC measurements reveal a ~10% decrease in trapped-hole density over low rates. Also, at high rates, up to ~2.5-times as many trapped holes are compensated by electrons in border traps than at low rates for these devices and irradiation conditions. Both the reduction in trapped-hole density and increased charge compensation reduce the high-rate midgap shift. A physical model is developed which suggests that both effects are caused by time-dependent space charge in the bulk of these soft oxides associated with slowly transporting and/or metastably trapped holes (e. g., in E centers). On the basis of this model, bipolar transistors and screen-oxide capacitors were irradiated at 60°C at 200 rad(SiO2)/s in a successful effort to match low-rate damage. These surprising results provide insight into enhanced low-rate bipolar gain degradation and suggest potentially promising new approaches to bipolar and BiCMOS hardness assurance for space applications. © 1994 IEEE",,"Capacitance measurement; Capacitors; Carrier concentration; Charge carriers; Crystal defects; Electric current measurement; Electric space charge; MOS devices; Oxides; Radiation damage; Semiconductor device models; Voltage measurement; Charge trapping; Radiation hardness; Thermally stimulated current measurement; Trapped hole density; Bipolar integrated circuits",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-AC04-94AL85000","We thank W.

Using this expression, the failure threshold voltages for the gate and drain can be analytically determined for any particular value of energy deposition along the ion's path or more commonly described as the ion's linear energy transfer (LET) function. This paper delineates our research, an in-depth study of vertical power DMOS transistors, having a 50-nm gate oxide and a strong SEGR response, subjected to various monoenergetic ions, representing particular values of LET between 0 and 83 MeV.cm2.mg-1. A description of the devices characterized, the test setup and test methodology employed, the failure threshold voltages measured, and the analysis techniques used are all summarized. Finally, an empirical equation is presented that portrays the locus of SEGR in the {-VGS, VDS} plane for all values of LET. © 1994 IEEE",,"Electric conductivity of solids; Electric currents; Energy transfer; Failure analysis; Gates (transistor); Ions; Numerical methods; Radiation damage; Semiconducting silicon; Linear energy transfer function; Power MOSFET devices; Single event gate rupture; MOSFET devices",,,,,,"This work is supported in part by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) and the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC).",,,,,,,,,,"Waskiewicz, A.E., Groninger, J.W., Strahan, V.H., Long, D.M., Burnout of Power MOS Transistors with Heavy Ions of 152-Cf (1986) IEEE Trans.

Three cells containing 31% KOH have failed after an average of 6400 cycles while the other three with 26% KOH have cycled for an average of 19 500 cycles. We have carried out post-cycle characterization tests and destructive physical analyses (DPA) of all cells. The DPA included visual inspections, measurements of electrode thickness, scanning electron microscopy, chemical analyses, and measurements of nickel electrode capacity in an electrolyte flooded cell. A gradual decrease of the usable cell capacity at high rate (1.4C) was the failure mode of all cells tested. Decrease of the usable capacity was due to decrease in the utilization of the active material with cycling mainly due to build-up of low rate capacity (residual capacity) and undischargeable active material. Cycle life of one of the cells might have been shortened prematurely due to the breakage of the cell core. Many gradual changes occurred with cycling at a rate which is independent of the KOH concentration. Each of these individual changes are difficult to be attributed to be the direct cause of the utilization decrease. However, an involved interaction of the changes might be responsible for the decrease. © 1994.",,"Capacitance measurement; Characterization; Chemical analysis; Composition effects; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Inspection; Materials testing; Nickel compounds; Pressure vessels; Scanning electron microscopy; Thickness measurement; Active materials; Cycling; Destructive physical analysis; Electrolyte flooded cell; Low earth orbit cycle life test; Nickel electrode capacity; Post cycle characterization tests; Electrolytes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lim, Verzwyvelt, (1988) Journal of Power Sources, 22, p. 213; Lim, Verzwyvelt, (1990) Journal of Power Sources, 29, p. 503; Smithrick, Hall, (1990) Proc. 25th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., Reno, NV, USA, 3, p. 16; Smithrick, Hall, (1991) Proc. 26th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., Boston, MA, USA, 3, p. 276; Lim, Smithrick, (1993) Proc. 28th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., Atlanta, GA, USA, 1, p. 151; Smithrick, Hall, (1992) Proc. 27th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., San Diego, CA, USA, 1, p. 215; Lim, Zelter, Smithrick, Hall, (1991) Proc. 26th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., Boston, MA, USA, 3, p. 304; Lim, Verzwyvelt, (1984) Proct. 19th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conf., San Francisco, CA, USA, p. 312","Lim, H.S.; Industrial Electronics Group, Hughes Aircraft Company, Torrance, CA 90505, United States",,,,,,,,03787753,,JPSOD,,"English","J Power Sources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028531637

The peak transconductance in the linear region increased in n channel devices and decreased in p channel devices for devices with lightly doped drain (LDD) implants. These changes were much larger as the temperature was decreased and were as much as a factor of 50 in P MOSFETs at 10K. The one technology without LDD showed only a minor change in gm with dose even at 10K.

We have analyzed the films for morphology and chemical nature by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy respectively.

In this work, the dose-rate dependence of bipolar current-gain degradation is mapped over a wide range of dose rates for the first time, and it is very different from analogous MOSFET curves. Annealing experiments following irradiation show negligible change in base current at room temperature, but significant recovery at temperatures of 100°C and above. In contrast to what is observed in MOSFET’s, irradiation and annealing tests cannot be used to predict the low-dose-rate response of bipolar devices. A comparison of x-ray-induced and 60Co gamma-ray-induced gain degradation is reported for the first time for bipolar transistors. The role of the emitter bias during irradiation is also examined.

This may be accomplished by increased volume efficiency and improved thermal performance of electronic components that make up a `lectronic system. One of these components is the Standard Electronic Module(SEM). The structural component of these modules is the module frame, which also is the thermal conduction path for passive cooling of the SEM. Composites including aluminum/graphite, copper/graphite, and epoxy/graphite are the primary focus of this investigation. Properties that make these materials attractive for this application are high thermal conductivity of the graphite fibers and the tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composite material. Weight savings is also a significant feature of these materials for avionics applications. The composite module frame was designed to meet the mechanical, environmental, and thermal performance requirements of the SEM Format E and evaluated in accordance with those requirements.

Because a Teflon lap wears slowly, it will retain its surface shape to produce extremely flat optical surfaces, λ/100, consistently and reliably for extended periods of time, of the order of days. To compare the two methods, we polished 50-mm-diameter samples of various optical materials, using colloidal suspensions in water on both pitch and Teflon laps under the same polishing conditions. Flatness was maintained to better than λ/10, and roughness less than 10 Å rms was measured on all samples by two Talystep surface-profiling instruments, one in the United States and one in Australia, with excellent agreement between measurements made by the two instruments. It was possible to obtain flat and smooth surfaces (<4-Å rms roughness) on all materials (except for F4, flint glass), but only certain combinations of material, abrasive, and lap could be used to give the correct polishing conditions and surface chemistry. © 1992 Optical Society of America.","Calcium fluoride; Lithium niobate; Magnesium fluoride; Optical fabrication; Optical polishing; Roughness; Silicon; Surfaces; Teflon lap; Zerodur",,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","Ceramic Machining (CECM) Workshop. Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Lab; 1991 Nov; ORNL/M-1745. 75 pages. A workshop on Cost Effective Ceramic Machining (CECM) was held at Oak Ridge Associated Universities Pollard Auditorium, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, May 1991. The purpose of this workshop was to present a preliminary project plan for industry critique and to identify specific components and cost-reduction targets for a new project on Cost Effective Ceramic Machining. The CECM project is an extension of the work on the Ceramic Technology for Advanced Heat Engines (CTAHE) Program sponsored by the Department of Energy, Office of Transportation Materials. The workshop consisted of fifteen invited papers, discussions, a survey of the attendee's opinions, and a tour of the High Temperature Materials Laboratory at ORNL. The total number of registrants was sixty-seven, including thirty-three from industry or private sector organizations, seven from universities, three from industry groups, fourteen from DOE laboratories (including ORNL, Y-12, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), three from trade associations, and three from other government organizations. Forty-one survey forms, which critiqued the proposed project plan, were completed by attendees, and the results are presented in this report. Valves, cam roller followers, water pump seals, and diesel engine head plates were rated highest fro application of ceramic machining concepts to reduce cost. Coarse grinding, abrasives and wheel technology, and fine grinding were most highly rated as regards their impact on cost reduction. Specific cost-reduction targets for given parts varied greatly in the survey results and were not felt to be useful for the purposes for the CECM plan development. A range of individual comments were obtained and are listed in an appendix. As a result of the workshop and subsequent discussions, a modified project plan, different in certain aspects from the original CECM plan, has been developed.",,,,,,,,,,"Leistner, A.J., Teflon polishers: Their manufacture and use (1976) Appl.

Some of the key development and manufacturing features of this program are outlined. The battery weighs approximately 145 lbs and is packaged in the nose of a MK 46 torpedo size store. Electrolyte, stored in a reservoir, is distributed to the 21 cells via a unique manifolding system. Activation is initiated by an explosive squib, and a stored energy system within the reservoir provides motive power. The 21 cells are divided into two sections. Performance requirements include extended operation at 4 kW constant power discharge. Each battery contains a large number of components, and automation has been developed to facilitate manufacture. A continuous coating process is used for the manufacture of cathode stock. Robots are used for the conversion of cathode stock into finished cathodes and for welding electrode tabs to current collectors. A comprehensive system of nonoperating electrical tests is used to determine product operability and safety. These tests include capacitance measurements to assure continuity of the unactivated series stacks and the integrity of the cell/manifold/activation system. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Capacitance measurement; Cathodes; Coated wire electrodes; Electrolytes; Lithium Chloride; Manufacture; Welding electrodes; Comprehensive system; Current collector; Electrical energy; Extended operations; Manufacturing features; Number of components; Performance requirements; Thionyl chlorides; Lithium batteries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","35th International Power Sources Symposium, IPSS 1992","22 June 1992 through 25 June 1992",,146433,,0780305523; 9780780305526,,,"English","Proc.

Secondary yields from the diamond films decline when they are subjected to continuous electron bombardment, but emission can be restored or enhanced if the surface is annealed in vacuum or exposed to hydrogen gas. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Carbon films; Diamond films; Electron devices; Electrons; NASA; Naval warfare; Secondary emission; Auburn universities; Electron bombardments; Exposed to; Hydrogen gas; Naval Surface Warfare Center; Research center; Secondary electron emissions; Secondary electron yield; Diamond like carbon films",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Curren, A.N., Jensen, K.A., (1985) Textured Carbon on Copper: A Novel Surface with Extremely Low Secondary Electron Emission Characteristics, , NASA TP 2543, December; Ebihara, B.T., Ramins, P., Peet, S., (1987) Traveling-Wave-Tube Efficiency Improvement by A Low-Cost Technique for Deposition of Carbon on Multistage Depressed Collector., , NASA TP 2719, May; Curren, A.N., Jensen, K.A., Roman, R.F., (1990) Secondary Electron Emission Characteristics of Molybdenum-Masked.

The author discusses the results of the materials analysis with particular attention to the NASA Goddard procedural process as modified by Crane Division, US Naval Surface Warfare Center, and the discrepancies between theoretical Cd:Ni electron exchange ratios and actual material analysis results on cells at complete discharge. The sets include baseline cells and cells after two shadow periods and five shadow periods of cycling in simulation of a polar low Earth orbit environment. The results of the chemical and physical characterizations are presented in a comparative manner, and the degradative effects on material properties are discussed. © 1992 IEEE.",,"Binary alloys; Cadmium; Cadmium alloys; Cells; Cytology; NASA; Naval warfare; Nickel; Orbits; Destructive-physical-analysis; Electron exchange; Low earth orbits; Material analysis; Materials analysis; Nickel cadmium; Physical characterization; US Naval Surface Warfare; Chemical analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Halpert, G., Kunigahalli, V., (1980) Procedures for Analysis of Nickel-Cadmium Cell Materials, , Document X-711- 74-279.

In this paper we examine the long term ionization response of five BiCMOS technologies by characterizing test structures which emphasize the various failure modes of CMOS and bipolar. The primary failure modes are found to be associated with the recessed field oxide isolation; edge leakage in the n channel MOSFETs and buried layer to buried layer leakage in the bipolar. The ionization failure thresholds for worst case bias were in the range of 5–20 Krad(Si) for both failure modes in all five technologies. © 1992 IEEE",,"Bipolar transistors; CMOS Integrated circuits; Gates (transistor); MOSFET devices; VLSI circuits; BiCMOS technologies; Radiation effects",,,,,"N00164-87-0010/0028","'Work funded by Defense Nuclear Agency through Naval Weapons Support Center under contract N00164-87-0010/0028.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, A.R., BiCMOS Technology and Applications (1989), Ed., Norwell Mass.: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Myrvaagnes, R., The Future is Bright for Digital BiCMOS (1991) Electronic Products, pp. 45-48. , June; Fleetwood, D.M., Winokur, P.S., Rieve, L.C., Pease, R.L., An Improved Standard Total Dose Test for CMOS Space Electronics (1989) IEEE Trans.

No single standard synthesis was effective for preparation of more than a few of the 25 free bases described; methods often unique to a base were employed. Minor variations in structure sometimes produced large differences in absorption and emission wavelengths, as well as in the magnitude of the extinction coefficient.

The Naval Sea System Command Miniature/Microminiature (2M) Electronic Repair Program has the responsibility of validating existing repair capabilities, developing new ones, and deploying them to U.S. Navy Organizational and Intermediate levels of repair. To support this effort, the 2M Program Manager initiated a repair study for electronic assemblies which employ surface mount technology (SMT). The study followed an initial SMT repair study that had been accomplished at Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station in 1987. The objective of the study was to evaluate SMT repair processes to determine if implementation would impact on the electronic hardware. Because of the increasing amount of SMT being used in new systems, the ability to accomplish field repairs will significantly affect life cycle costs and operational availability. The study required that suitable test assemblies be designed and fabricated, have components placed on them, and that they be reworked under controlled conditions to assure the integrity of the resultant data. The most significant findings are that all of the evaluated processes can accomplish SMT repairs; however, the processes must be understood and controllable if successful repairs are to be accomplished. No detrimental effects were identified that would preclude deploying these capabilities beyond the depot repair facility.",,"Availability; Costs; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Printed circuit testing; Process control; Reliability; Service life; Surface mount technology; Depot repair facility; Life cycle; Operational availability; Rework; Repair",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crawford, Jack; Naval Weapons Support Cent, Crane, United States",,"EMPF","EMPF, Indianapolis, IN, United States","Proceedings of the 1991 Electrecon Conference","22 October 1991 through 23 October 1991","Indianapolis, IN, USA",44701,,,00235,,"English","Electrecon Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026411623

In this work, 60Co irradiation testing was performed on bipolar test structures. The effects of collector bias, dose rate, and anneal temperature are discussed. Major differences in the radiation response of polysilicon emitter transistors are demonstrated as a function of dose rate. The worst-case gain degradation occurs at the lowest dose rate complicating hardness assurance testing procedures. The dose rate and anneal data suggest that MIL-STD-883B Test Method 1019.4 is non-conservative for polysilicon emitter transistors, which show enhanced radiation hardness over the crystalline emitter transistors. © 1991 IEEE",,"Crystals; Electronic Circuits; Semiconducting Silicon; Ionizing Radiation; Polysilicon; Transistors, Bipolar",,,,,"N00164-87-D-0010/0032; DNA Genotek","*Work funded by DNA through Naval Weapons Support Center under contract N00164-87-D-0010/0032",,,,,,,,,,"Tang, D.D., Solomom, P.M., Ning, T.N., Isaac, R.D., Burger, R.E., 1.25 µ m Deep-Groove-Isolated Self-Aligned Aligned Bipolar Circuits (1982) IEEE J.

The results indicate that radiation causes significant changes in the frequency dependence of the noise of the power MOSFETs studied. Before exposure to radiation, the noise power spectral density indicated a 1/fλ relationship where λ ranged from approximately 0.5 to 1.0. As the total dose level increased, λ approached unity, while the magnitude of the noise increased proportionally with the radiation-induced charge density. In addition, noise measurements were performed after irradiation, while the devices were annealing under a ±12 V bias. It was found that, under the +12 V bias, λ increased and under the −12 V bias, λ decreased. Finally, no correlation was found between the pre-irradiation 1/f noise magnitude and the radiation hardness of these DMOS power transistors. © 1991 IEEE",,"Transistors--Noise; Transistors--Radiation Hardening; 1/F Noise; Ionizing Radiation; Semiconductor Devices, MOS",,,,,"DNA001 -88-C-004","This work was supported in part by the Defense Nuclear Agency through contract number DNA001 -88-C-004 and by the Naval Weapons Support Center.

A recent industry study hypothesized that sub-surface oxidation may correlate to solderability degradation. The 'layer' of material immediately below the tin/lead solder surface layer in most solder joints is a Cu6Sn5 intermetallic. The growth of this intermetallic and a Cu3Sn intermetallic (during long-term component storage) depletes the tin available in the solder coating, leaving a thin, porous layer of lead-rich material to protect the solderable intermetallics from oxidation. Hence, additional knowledge about the solderability of the Cu6Sn5 intermetallic is valuable for determining maximum allowable storage times for components while still maintaining a high degree of solderability. In this investigation, solderability of the Cu6Sn5 intermetallic, relative to normal and elevated temperature aging conditions, was determined using a solder area-of-spread test. The results show that oxides quickly form on the intermetallic which render it unsolderable without flux within 1.5 minutes of sample preparation. The oxides, formed at temperatures up to 110°C for up to 1000 hours, can be removed by using a type 'RMA' flux during the soldering operation, which results in solder wetting angles from 2.5° to 5.1°.",,"Intermetallics - Soldering; Soldering - Testing; Solders; PWB; Solderability; Printed Circuits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hoffer, Kip O.; Naval Weapons Support Cent, Crane, United States","Anon",,"Publ by Cahner Exposition Group, Des Plaines, IL, United States","Proceedings of the Technical Program of the National Electronic Packaging and Production Conference - NEPCON West '91","24 February 1991 through 28 February 1991","Anaheim, CA, USA",14781,04700155,,NEPPA,,"English","Proc Tech Program Natl Electron Packag Prod Conf",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025839348

A previous study showed that molten BDD decomposes thermally via a multistep process that produces a variety of condensed phase and gaseous products. The nature of the products suggested that proton transfer from cation to anion followed by C-N bond rupture occurred early in the decomposition process. During the present investigation condensed phase DSC induction period studies performed using specifically deuterated BDD analogs generally displayed inverse deuterium isotope effects. Impact sensitivities, times to explosion and critical temperatures were also determined for BDD, the BAK composites, and many of their N-deuterated analogs. While these studies did not unequivocally reveal the specific covalent bond rupture responsible for generating the conditions favorable for exothermic decomposition, they did provide a direct relationship between induction period chemistry and macroscopic thermal sensitivity properties. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"2303E1","was sponsored by the A i r Force","This hypothesis i s supported by the",,,,,,,,,"Shackelford, S.A., Beckmann, J.W., Wilkes, J.S., (1977) J.

In the theoretical calculations, potential-energy surface information is obtained using multiconfiguration self-consistent-field and large-scale multireference configuration-interaction calculations with large correlation consistent basis sets. The preferred direction of approach is found to be along a non-least-motion pathway for which the BH and DD bonds come in nearly parallel to one another. The small computed activation energy of 2.6 kcal/mol for this highly exothermic reaction is found to arise almost exclusively from changes in zero-point vibrational energy. The experimental measurements of the BH disappearance rate are made at temperatures from 298 to 597 K and are shown to be only weakly dependent on total pressure over the range of 1-100 Torr. As a test of the proposed mechanism, we observe the growth of BD and find the BD appearance rate constant to be in excellent agreement with that for BH disappearance. The measured reaction rates are compared to the results of canonical variational transition-state theory calculations of the association rate and are found to be in excellent agreement. © 1990 American Institute of Physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yetter, R.A., Rabitz, H., Dryer, F.L., Brown, R.C., Kolb, C.E., Combust.

The shock-cell and shear-layer structure variation with the pressure ratio is shown to be related to the near-field pressure fluctuations. Near the sonic, fully adapted velocity, the jet is fully symmetric. An abrupt change to a flapping mode occurs at a low Mach number, causing a large increase in the spreading rate, which is also related to the appearance of an upstream propagating screech component. This behavior is observed at the minor axis plane, whereas the other plane remains symmetric. As the pressure ratio is further increased, the jet growth is decreased concurrently with the reduction of the upstream propagating pressure component. At the same time, the broadband near-field pressure fluctuations are enhanced. At the highest pressure ratio measured, the jet becomes quasisymmetric, with a dominant helical screech tone and a very large spreading rate at both axis planes. © 1990 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,"Acoustics; Computers, Microcomputer; Mixing; Photography - Schlieren System; Mach Number; Rectangular Supersonic Jets; Shock-Cell Structure; Spark Schlieren Photography; Flow of Fluids",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ho, C.M., Gutmark, E., Vortex Induction and Mass En-trainment in a Small Aspect Ratio Elliptic Jet (1987) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 179, pp. 383-405; Schadow, K.C., Wilson, K.J., Lee, M.J., Gutmark, E., Enhancement of Mixing in Reacting Fuel-Rich Plumes Issued from Elliptical Nozzles (1987) Journal of Propulsion and Power, 3, pp. 145-149. , March-April; Krothapalli, A., Baganoff, D., Karamcheti, K., On the Mixing of a Rectangular Jet (1981) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 107, pp. 201-220; Krothapalli, A., Hsia, Y., Baganoff, D., Karamcheti, K., (1982) On the Structure of an Underexpanded Rectangular Jet, , Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA, AIAA TR-47, July; Glass, D.R., Effects of Acoustic Feedback on the Spread and Decay of Supersonic Jets (1968) AIAA Journal, 6, pp. 1890-1897. , Oct; Gutmark, E., Schadow, K.C., Wilson, K.J., (1987) Noncircular Jet Dynamics in Supersonic Combustion, , AIAA Paper 87-1878; Seiner, M., (1984) Advances in High Speed Jet Aeroacoustics, , AIAA Paper 84-2275; Tam, C.K.W., Burton, D.E., Sound Generated by Instability Waves of Supersonic Flows (1984) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 138, pp. 249-295; Schadow, K.C., Wilson, K.J., Gutmark, E., Characterization of Large-Scale Structures in a Forced Ducted Flow with Dump (1987) AIAA Journal, 25, pp. 1164-1170. , Sept; Tam, C.K.W., (1986) On the Screech Tones of Supersonic Rectangular Jets, , AIAA Paper 86-1866; Gutmark, E., Schadow, K.C., Wilson, K.J., Bicker, C.J., Acoustic Radiation and Flow Instabilities in Low Supersonic Circular and Elliptic Jets (1988) Physics of Fluids, 31, pp. 2524-2532. , Sept; Gutmark, E., Schadow, K.C., Bicker, C.J., Mode Switching in Supersonic Circular Jets (1989) Physics of Fluids, 1, pp. 868-873. , May; Koshigoe, S., Gutmark, E., Schadow, K.C., Tubis, A., Initial Development of Noncircular Jets Leading to Axis Switching (1989) AIAA Journal, 27, pp. 411-419. , April",,,,,,,,,00011452,,,,"English","AIAA J",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025464738

The article describes how basic ideas of mathematics of fractals can be applied to study the changes in the irregularity of the flame's surface at various axial positions. In the present work, the Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) imaging technique has been used to map the hydroxyl concentration in an annular diffusion flame with propane fuel. The short pulse duration (18 ns) of the laser sheet enabled instantaneous pictures of the flame structure to be obtained with high spatial resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. The isopleths of concentration were highly wrinkled and random in character, both in space and time. They were measured in flames that were forced at different instability frequencies, in order to stabilize the roll-up of the vortices in the flame shear layer and to simulate vortex merging. Measurements were done from the flameholder to the flame's end at many axial positions, in order to study the evolution of the flame structure. The fractal dimension was calculated for all these conditions, using two methods: the Kolmogorov-Hansdorff definition and the perimeter area relation. The fractal dimension of this flame was found to be in the range of 1.03-1.1, depending on the axial location. A verified convergence of the fractal dimension to a constant value is critical to reduce the scatter in its value in different sets of experiment. © 1990.",,"Imaging Techniques; Propane - Combustion; Flame Structure; Fractal Dimension; Kolmogorov-Hansdorff Definition; PLIF Imaging Technique; Turbulent Wrinkled Diffusion Flame; Flame Research; article; combustion; diffusion; flame; methodology; nonhuman; theoretical study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tennekes, Lumley, (1983) A First Course in Turbulences, , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Wu, Law, (1984) Twentieth Symposium on Combustion, pp. 1941-1949. , The Combustion Institute, Pittsburgh; Bilger, (1989) Annu.

Analytical techniques used for this work were differential scanning and accelerating rate calorimetry, thermogravimetry, tandem gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. It was shown that BDD decomposes thermally from the molten state via a multistep process that produces a variety of condensed phase and gaseous products. The nature of the products suggest that a proton transfer reaction from cation to anion followed by C-N bond rupture occurs early in the decomposition process. The presence of early heterocyclic reaction products demonstrates that one of the reaction mechanisms involves cycloelimination. Later reactions appear to be competitive and may proceed through transient, primary nitramine and nitrosamine species. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dobratz, B.M., (1983) Etbylenediamine Dinitrate and Its Eutectic Mixtures: A Historical Review of the Literature to 1982, , LA-9732-H, May, AD-A131641; Campbell, A.N., Campbell, A., (1947) Canad.

The methodology of the test program was to evaluate comparatively the performance characteristics of cells manufactured using the 2536 material and those of cells manufactured using 2505 ML material. Early in the test program, performance anomalies, in particular, cell voltage divergence, began to appear in several battery packs undergoing low Earth orbit (LEO) cycling. The data obtained from this test program do not support the use of Pellon 2536 separator in current GEP nickel-cadmium spacecraft cells under these LEO test conditions. Separator dry-out was a major factor in the anomalous performance of the cells containing the 2536 material. Cells containing Pellon 2505 ML separator displayed similar performance characteristics to those of the 2536 separator cells, but generally later in life. Some of these failures were attributed to at least one roll of deficient separator material. However, failures also occurred in cells containing 2505 ML separator which did not contain any of the deficient material identified to date. This indicates that other performance factors may be involved.

Results of nonreacting tests in air and water flows as well as combustion experiments in a diffusion flame and dump combustor are discussed to provide insight into the generation process of large-scale structures in the combustor flow and their interaction with the combustion process. It is shown that the flow structures, or vortices, are formed by interaction between the flow instabilities and the chamber acoustic resonance. When these vortices dominate the reacting flow, the combustion is confined initially to the circumference of their cores and further downstream proceeds into their core, leading to periodic heat release, which may result in the driving of high amplitude pressure oscillations. These oscillations are typical to the occurrence of combustion instabilities for certain operating conditions. The basic understanding of the interaction between flow dynamics and the combustion process opens up the possibility for rational control of combustion-induced pressure oscillations. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The center jet had a fully-expanded Mach number of 3, and the outer jet of M = 1.8. The geometries of the center jet were circular and rectangular with two configurations, both with a 3:1 aspect-ratio. The convective Mach numbers were varied in the range between 0.25 &lt; Mc &lt; 2.25. This was accomplished by varying the density ratio between the center jet and the coaxial jet, as well as the velocity ratio. The experimental compressible spreading rate was determined using Schlieren photography and total-pressure measurements. The spreading rate of the center circular jet decreased with increasing convective Mach number until it reached a constant value of 0.2 to 0.3 of the incompressible spreading rate for Mc &gt; 1.4.

The objective was to initiate the combustion as close as possible to the flameholder surface and to maintain uniform combustion in the entire mixing region. Forcing was applied to both the air and fuel streams, at different frequencies and amplitudes. The air jet was excited at its preferred mode frequency while the fuel was forced at higher harmonics in order to trigger and amplify the initial instabilities of the coaxial jet. Nonreacting tests showed that the combined forcing was promoting an earlier transition to small-scale turbulence at the nozzle's exit. Consequently, the combustion was enhanced and became uniformly distributed along the flame, contrary to the reference unforced flame where intense combustion started only at a distance from the flameholder and was limited to the region where vortical structures developed. The optimal combination of forcing parameters are presented and discussed. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The primary failure mode encountered on FET's in this environment was susceptibility to single event burnout. Burnout of the power DMOS FET was catastrophic. Another failure mode was single event gate rupture. Although gate rupture is not as severe as burnout, its long-term effects are not known. Single event gate rupture causes performance degradation due to increased gate leakage current. An increase in current can pose serious problems to applications that cannot compensate for the added performance degradation. Long-term reliability of the gate oxide may be affected resulting in premature device failure. Each failure mode will be discussed. Numerous processing lots were fabricated to experimentally verify that each failure mode could be successfully minimized. Test results have shown that an n-channel, 150-volt DMOS FET was fabricated that survived exposures to ions with LET's up to 80 MeV-cm2/mg. Finally, hardening approaches will be discussed, including the advantages and disadvantages of each approach on the FET's performance. © 1989 IEEE",,"Accelerators; Cosmic Rays; Ion Beams; DMOS (Double Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor) Devices; Single Event Upsets; Semiconductor Devices, MOSFET",,,,,"N00164-86-C-0182","The effects of a cosmic ray environment on power DMOS FET's were researched and documented extensively. Two failure modes were identified. The main failure mode observed was single event burnout (SEB), which was catastrophic, resulting in drain-to-gate and drain-to-source resistive shorts. The other failure mqde observed was single event gate rupture (SEGR), which was detrimental to the device's performance and resulted in an increase of gate and drain leakage currents. Hypothetically, single event burnout is caused by avalanche breakdown of the parasitic NPN bipolar transistor inherent in the MOSFET To prevent single event burnout, process and design modifications were directed at reducing the parasitic NPN transistor bipolar effects and suppressing the turn-on of said bipolar. To prevent single event gate rupture, process and design modifications were directed toward reducing the electric fields along the gate oxide interface. However, only those changes that were thought to reduce the probability of a cosmic-ray-induced failure were implemented. Burnout threshold voltage and gate rupture effects were evaluated on devices which had been fabricated with specific changes and, subsequently, were exposed to heavy ions.

For typical microcircuit layouts, (the trench polysilicon is ground or floating) the irradiation data at a total dose of greater than 1 Mrad(SiO2) showed identical saturation of the threshold voltage shift and minimal interface state buildup regardless of the source and drain irradiation bias conditions.

For such a calculation, the scattered field is theoretically well defined, but numerical problems have been found near resonant frequencies. To study these problems, the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in moment method calculations is developed, and the reason the SVD is the appropriate tool for the numerical analysis of any moment method calculation (even when the matrix equation is to be solved by an iterative technique) is shown. In particular, the SVD casts a moment method calculation into a diagonal form, which allows a careful numerical analysis. The problems near resonance are found to be due to the creation of an approximate impedance matrix Z, which has the wrong resonant frequency (i.e., it is not consistent with that of the radiation problem). One numerical method that avoids these difficulties by using the SVD is discussed, and other more efficient ways of avoiding the usual numerical difficulties are suggested. © 1989 IEEE",,"Mathematical Techniques--Integral Equations; Resonators, Cavity; Cavity Resonance Problem; Method of Moments; Singular Value Decomposition; Electromagnetic Waves",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mautz, J.R., Harrington, R.F., H-field, E-field, and combined-field solutions for conducting bodies of revolution Lectures on Computational Methods in Electromagnetics, , R.

The generalized shooting method is applied to jets with elliptic-core and equilateral-triangular-core regions of constant flow. The analysis reveals that in order to have the deformation, three requirements must be present in the behavior of the eigenmodes of noncircular jets: 1) the eigenfunctions are localized without excessive overlapping; 2) the amplification rates of the corresponding eigenmodes are comparable; and 3) sufficient phase speed difference exists between the eigenmodes. The qualitative behavior of the noncircular jets found through the numerical analysis is compared with experimental results and are in good correlation with them. © 1989 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,"Flow of Fluids - Jets; Mathematical Techniques - Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions; Structural Analysis; Axis Switching; Noncircular Jets; Rayleigh Equation; Structural Deformation; Triangular Core Jets; Aircraft",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","We wish to thank R.

As a result of spot tests as well as spectrophotometric experiments, p-benzoquinone (BQ) was identified as a major degradation product. The overall number of electrons consumed per anilinium unit for the oxidation followed by degradation of PA was determined to be approximately two employing coulometric experiments. The yield for the BQ generation was close to 100% based on this number of electrons transferred. During the later stages of the degradation, the net hydrolysis rate follows first-order kinetics and is a function of the film thickness. In addition, the hydrolysis reaction is shown to cease upon open circuit of the cell. Finally, a reaction mechanism which accounts for the observed behaviors is proposed. © 1988, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The present work shows that the Tam and Zardecki approach can be applied to the inhomogeneous case. Specifically, a solution is obtainedfor a slab shaped scattering medium.

These measurements are compared to calculations of the nonionizing energy deposition in silicon as a function of particle type and energy. Measurements were made of displacement damage factors for 2N2222A and 2N2907A switching transistors, and for 2N3055, 2N6678, and 2N6547 power transistors, as a function of collector current using 3.7 - 175 MeV protons, 4.3 - 37 MeV deuterons, and 16.8 - 65 MeV helium ions. Long term ionization effects on the value of the displacement damage factors were taken into account. In calculating the energy dependence of the nonionizing energy deposition, Rutherford, nuclear elastic, and nuclear inelastic interactions, and Lindhard energy partition were considered. The main conclusions of the work are as follows: 1) The ratio of the displacement damage factors for a given charged particle to the 1 MeV equivalent neutron damage factor, as a function of energy, falls on a common curve which is independent of collector current. 2) Deuterons of a given energy are about twice as damaging as protons and helium ions are about eighteen times as damaging as protons. 3) The ratios of the calculated nonionizing energy deposition in silicon by protons, deuterons, and helium ions as a function of energy to the calculated nonionizing energy deposition by 1 MeV neutrons, agree exactly with the experimental damage factor ratios over the whole energy range considered, with no fitted parameters. 4) This agreement means that there is a linear dependence of the experimental displacement damage factors on nonionizing energy deposition for all particles (including neutrons) and for all energies. 5) Therefore, the damage factors for different particles are directly proportional to the number of defects originally produced, are not affected by defect cascades, and are independent of the PKA spectrum.

In combustion tests with thermocouples, mixing between the reacting fuel-rich plume and the coaxial air was also enhanced with elliptical nozzles. This resulted in higher local combustion temperatures and therefore higher reaction rates near the nozzle exit.

The measurements of Kp were made on specially selected lots of devices and were compared to values of the neutron damage factors, Kn, for 1 MeV displacement damage equivalent neutrons made on the same devices. The results show that so far as device operation is concerned, the nature of the displacement damage produced by high energy protons and by fission neutrons is essentially the same. Over the energy range studied, protons were found to be more damaging than neutrons. For 5.0 MeV protons Kp/Kn was about 8.5 compared to about 1.8 for 60.3 MeV protons.

They possess optical, mechanical, and thermal properties that are superior to those of currently used Irtran-1 domes. Optical performance of these materials in the visible wavelength region far exceeds that of Irtran-1, while infrared properties reported here vary from worse than to better than Irtran-1 domes. Reported in this paper are measurements of optical scatter and transmittance at 0.4762, 0.6471, and 3.39 μm, which represent a large range of values obtained on these materials in dome form. Processing changes over the last few years have produced improvements in both scatter and transmittance, provided that a good surface finish is maintained. Higher index of refraction will, of course, limit the ultimate transmittance for uncoated domes of these materials to slightly less than that of Irtran-1, which has also improved in the same time period. Calculations indicate maximum transmittance at 3.39 pm to be 0.95 to 0.96 for Irtran-1 and 0.87 to 0.88 for spinel, a difference of 0.08. Current measurements at the Naval Weapons Center confirm values of 0.88 for spinel, while the best Irtran-1 dome gave a value of less than 0.92. © 1984 SPIE.",,"ALUMINUM COMPOUNDS - Optical Properties; SAPPHIRE - Applications; ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION - Scattering; ADVANCED PERFORMANCE DOMES; ALUMINUM OXYNITRIDE; OPTICAL SCATTER; ULTIMATE TRANSMITTANCE; OPTICAL VARIABLES MEASUREMENT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0277786X,,,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021692506

In combustion tests using gaseous fuels, the combustion efficiency was increased by 10 percent compared to circular gas-generator nozzles when elliptic nozzles were used.

When instruments became programmable, it appeared that increased worker efficiency could be added to their advantages. However, the lack of programming standards and a method to automatically set up inter-instrument communication has prevented instruments from reaching their full potential. Because the test system software had to address the unique programming characteristics of the test instruments, initial test-system cost was high to cover the custom software effort, and versatility needed for changes and additions of testing capability was low. A new concept of using programmable test instruments has been developed to overcome these problems: ROLAIDS. ROLAIDS is the acronym for Reconfigurable On-Line ATE Information Distribution System. ROLAIDS provides an initialization protocol and a standard information structure, the Resource Description, for overcoming the present-day limitations of IEEE-488 instruments in automatic test systems.",,"AUTOMATIC TESTING; AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT (ATE); PROGRAMMABLE TEST INSTRUMENTS; RECONFIGURABLE ON-LINE ATE INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (ROLAIDS); INSTRUMENTS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sollman, Larry; US Naval Weapons Support Cent,, , US Naval Weapons Support Cent, Crane, IN, USA",,"Electronics Test","Morgan-Grampian Publ Co, New York, NY, USA","Proceedings - ATE Central: Automated Testing for Electronics Manufacturing Conference.",,"Rosemont, IL, USA",7497,,,,,"English",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020868013

Typical failure levels are in the 10–100 Krad(Si) range. Failure was found to be a strong function of irradiation bias and annealing time after irradiation. In addition, total dose “win-dows” below 100 Krad(Si) were observed. The radiation failure mechanism is predominantly inversion of p type silicon either at the bottom of the recessed field oxide, causing buried layer to buried layer channeling, or on the oxide sidewall causing collector to emitter leakage. In addition, a failure mode due to increased sidewall current was observed in a nonisolated form of integrated injection logic. Hardening approaches have been identified and investigated at several manufacturers. Device failure levels were found to vary by several orders of magnitude depending on process lot and layout revision.

Attention has not yet been placed on the analysis of the combustion products from these devices which may be hazardous. Combustion products from these colored smokes containing organic dyes produced at the normal function temperature (approximately 400°C–600°C) of the compositions have been studied in our laboratory. The five dyes contained in the smoke compositions studied are: benzanthrone, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene‐7,14‐dione, 1,4‐di‐p‐toluidino‐anthraquinone, 1‐methylamino‐anthraquinone, and α‐xylene‐azo‐β‐naphthol. A modified EPA‐Method 5 sampling train containing Amberlite XAD‐2 as the absorbant was used to sample the organic vapors and particulates in the effluent. ánalytical methods used to separate, purify, and identify the products include TLC, HPLC, GC, GC‐MS, and NMR. Minimum destruction of the organic dyes is desired for a good smoke. Our preliminary investigations indicate that 90%–95% of the organic dye sublimes while the other 5%–10% is lost to combustion. The combustion products observed, to date, have been identified as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and polynuclear organic materials (POM's) which are the result of thermal decomposition and thermal rearrangement of the parent dyes. At the temperature of functioning, no ring opening of the dyes has been observed. Copyright © 1983 Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present experiment measurements of the spectral absorption coefficient have been made at a series of temperatures to determine whether the resulting changes in the shape of the spectrum can be attributed to contributions by specific vibrational levels of the lower electronic state. Due to the relatively high frequency of the C-O stretching mode (2062 cm-1) only the bending (520 cm-1) and C-S stretching (859 cm-1) modes are excited at the temperatures of these experiments. The results show that the electronic transition moment is not independent of vibrational excitation of the lower state, but increases significantly with excitation of the bending mode, and even more significantly with excitation of the C-S stretching mode. The spectral absorption coefficient attributed to the ground state and to each of these vibrational states has roughly similar Gaussian outline but is shifted progressively toward longer wavelength with increasing vibrational excitation. The limitations on the use of this vibronic system as a probe for the vibrational distribution of the lower state under nonthermal excitation conditions are discussed. © 1983 American Chemical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bair, E.J.; Department of Chemistry, , Bloomington, IN 47405, United States",,,,,,,,00223654,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000860876

Accurate measurement of these quantities is an experimental problem with numerous subtle sources of systematic error. For precise analysis, it is essential that these measurements be performed at the actual temperatures of use - in many modern applications, this implies temperatures substantially different from room temperature. This paper describes methods generally employed for both absolute and relative measurements, including optical and electronic signal processing implications. Although detector spatial nonuniformity is widely recognized as a serious concern, equally so and often totally neglected are variations in transmission of windows employed in elevated or cryogenic temperature measurements. Another serious problem, often not adequately recognized, concerns the degradation of the sample from condensed contaminants at cryogenic temperatures or oxides at high temperatures. An instrument will be described which successfully addresses these problems and is capable of providing measurements of sample reflectance or transmittance while protecting the sample under ultrahigh vacuum (< 10-9 torr). Relative reflectance data taken with this instrument are presented and analyzed which have an accuracy of 3 x 10 -5. © 1982 SPIE.",,"Cryogenics; Reflection; Signal processing; Temperature measurement; Thin films; Accurate measurement; Cryogenic temperatures; Electronic signal processing; Experimental problems; Modern applications; Relative measurement; Spatial nonuniformity; Techniques of measurements; Optical films",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anthon, E., Spatially Uniform Detector Assemblies, , This proceedings; Smith, A., (1960) J.

The 1.06-μm pulse laser-induced damage threshold was increased by a factor of 4.6 by a temperature annealing process. The starting material for this work was single-crystal “laser grade” NaCl acquired from the Harshaw Chemical Company. The bulk laser-induced damage threshold of the crystal was measured prior to and after the heat treatment using a Nd:YAG laser operated at 1.06 pm in the TEM00 spatial mode with a pulse width of 9 nsec, full width at half maximum. After the laser-induced damage threshold of the untreated crystal was meas-ured, it was mounted in a quartz tube and placed in an oven for the heat treatment. The quartz tube was continuously flushed with dry nitrogen throughout the heat treatment. The NaC1 sample was slowly heated to 794°C (approximately 7°C below its melting temperature). The sample was maintained at this temperature for a short time and was then removed from the oven to allow rapid cooling. The specimen required repolishing after the heat treatment because of surface sublimation which occurred at temperatures near melting. After repolishing, the bulk laser-induced breakdown intensity was remeasured and found to be 4.6 times greater than the value measured for the untreated crystal. © 1982 SPIE.",,"Heat treatment; Laser pulses; Melting; Neodymium lasers; Optical materials; Ovens; Quartz; Single crystals; Sodium chloride; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Chemical companies; Laser induced damage thresholds; ND : YAG lasers; Pulse laser induced damage; Rapid cooling; Spatial modes; Temperature annealing; Temperature cycling; Laser damage",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR","This work was a joint effort by North Texas State University, Denton, Texas, and the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, and was funded by the Office of Naval Research.",,,,,,,,,,"Bloembergen, N., Laser-Induced Electric Breakdown in Solids (1974) IEEE J.

An integral equation satisfied by the Laplace-transformed dipole distribution is derived by appealing to the piezoelectric reciprocity relation. The solution of the integral equation is accomplished by expanding the dipole distribution in a series of first-order spline functions with unknown coefficients and then applying the method of moments to transform the problem to a vector-matrix one, which is readily handled by a computer. Inversion back into the time domain is effected by an efficient numerical method of inverting Laplace transforms.

Measured values for the diffusion coefficient at 1000 °C are Dy=9.4×10-13 and Dz=1.4×10-12 cm2/sec. The ratio of the extraordinary to the ordinary surface index change (Δne/ Δn0) was found to vary between 1.3 and 1.8, depending on diffusion temperature and Ti film thickness. Ti and Li concentration profiles were measured by secondary-ion mass spectrometry. Additional high concentration peaks, 0.2-0.3 μm wide for both ions, were found superimposed on otherwise well-behaved diffusion profiles. This observation is interpreted to result from a tendency towards Li-Ti-O compound (Li2TiO3 or Li 2Ti3O7) formation at the diffusion temperature in a dilute mixture with LiNbO3. Such compound formation has the effect of impeding the Ti diffusion into the LiNbO3 substrate. Electron microprobe measurements were used to measure lateral diffusion from channel waveguides. Under nominally identical conditions, lateral diffusion coefficients varying by as much as a factor of 3 have been observed. The minimum lateral diffusion coefficients observed at 1000 °C were D y=9.7×10-13 and Dz=1.4×10 -12 cm2/sec.",,"WAVEGUIDES, OPTICAL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Schmidt, R.V., Kaminow, I.P., (1974) Appl. Phys.

The program is structured to provide system designers with a flexible set of electronic functions and packaging hardware for the design and production of military electronic equipment. SEM has demonstrated that a standardization program with appropriate quality assurance controls can provide a significant increase in equipment reliability. Following a brief overview citing some of the accomplishments of the program, the packaging technology aspects of the program are detailed. Packaging aspects addressed include mechanical definition, thermal definition, and recent evolutionary changes. A discussion of current SEM packaging development efforts follows. Finally, SEM-related avionics packaging development efforts are described. © 1979 IEEE",,"AVIONICS; ELECTRONICS PACKAGING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prokop, J.S., Williams, D.W., Chip Carriers as a Means for High-Density Packaging (1978) IEEE Trans.

Transient logic upset was not observed at ionizing radiation dose rates of less than lx109rads(Si)/sec. The primary failure mode in the neutron and total ionizing dose environments was found to be a reduction in up-gain of the npn portion of the I2L cell.

The store consisted of an Mk 83 bomb shape mounted on a triple-ejector rack (TER) on an F- 4 aircraft which was instrumented complete with a standard research boom mounted on the nose. The flight conditions spanned Mach 0.6-0.9 in both maneuvering and steady flight. Corresponding wind-tunnel tests were made at 5% at both the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) and the David Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center (DTNSRDC), as well as tests at 10% at DTNSRDC. The data show good correlation between flight test and wind tunnel for moderate subsonic Mach numbers when good geometric similarity is maintained, but there is a pronounced divergence in this agreement as the Mach number is increased. Correlation between mathematical models of this problem and the flight test show the same magnitude in loads and moments, but the trends do not always agree.

Results similar to that previously reported for Be-implanted GaAs are observed, including outdiffusion of Be into the Si3N4 encapsulant during 900‡C annealing of high dose implants. Nearly all (85-100%) of the Be remaining after a 900‡C, 1/2 hr anneal is electrically active. However, the electrical activation at low annealing temperatures (600-700‡C) is much lower in GaAs0.6P0.4 than in GaAs. A substantial amount of diffusion is observed even for the low fluence Be implants in GaAs0.6P0.4 annealed at 900‡C, indicating a greater dependence of the diffusion on defect-related effects in the ternary. © 1978 AIME.","III-V compounds; ion implantation","SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - Ion Implantation; SEMICONDUCTING GALLIUM COMPOUNDS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chatterjee, P.K., Streetman, B.G., Keune, D.L., Herzog, A.H., (1975) 1975 IEDM Tech.

It is shown that a pulsed GaAs laser effectively simulates the effects caused by high energy ionizing radiation on integrated circuit devices. Experimental data is presented on several LSI complexity level devices manufactured with I2L technology. The data shows excellent correlation of failure modes between LINAC and laser tests. Good quantitative agreement has been obtained between LINAC and laser upset levels. This is desirable, but not necessary since the laser test is not considered to be a replacement for LINAC or Flash X-ray testing. The laser has been used in conjunction with an optical microscope and a micromanipulator to observe voltage waveforms at internal circuit nodes and to selectively shadow small areas of the chip during the transient event. This provides a powerful diagnostic tool for analysis of basic failure mechanisms.

Reactions of isocyanates produce diamides; diethyl azodicarboxylate produces a dihydrazine and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate produces a diolefin. The ligands have been displaced intact from the metal with H2S and are identical with those prepared catalytically. Ni(acac)2 also catalyzes the addition of these electrophiles, to free Hacac and it is demonstrated that catalysis proceeds via reaction of a coordinated ligand. Other metal 2,4-pentanedionates, Mg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Li(I), Mn(III), Cu(II), and Fe(III), also catalyze the reaction of PhN=C=O with Hacac, but Cr(acac)3, Pd(acac)2, and Al(acac)3 do not. The relative catalytic efficiency of these 2,4-pentanedionates was determined. The new compounds were fully characterized by elemental analyses, melting points, and infrared, electronic, and NMR spectroscopy. A mechanism for these reactions is proposed and discussed.

The system enables the computer generation of system corrected and signal averaged plots of spectral radiant intensity versus wavelength in the case of flare emissions, and the generation of plots of transmittance versus wavelength as a function of time in the case of smoke obscuration experiments. The system consists of several commercially available components. A dual channel scanning spectrometer, presently setup for the 1.7 to 4.7 micrometer region, enables spectra to be obtained repetitively with scan times of 1, 50, 100, or 500 msec, and with a resolution (at the slowest scan times) of 0.004 micrometers. Two channels of spectroscopic data, a number of channels of radiometric data, and various synchronization pulses are recorded on a 14-channel analog tape recorder. The spectroscopic and radiometric data are then digitized, using as many as 2000 points per spectral scan per channel. System corrected, absolute intensity spectra are generated in the computer by calculations involving the flare spectral data, spectra of a Globar source, and the radiometric data. The system is flexible in that a variety of gratings, filters, and detectors make it possible to use this system in the near ultraviolet, visible, near, and middle infrared. © 1977 SPIE.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Data acquisition; Micrometers; Radiometry; Smoke; Spectrometers; Spectroscopic analysis; Absolute intensity; Computer generation; Function of time; Near ultraviolet; Radiant intensities; Radiometric data; Spectroscopic data; Synchronization pulse; High speed photography",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Norcon Instrument Co., Norwalk, Connecticut; Dinerman, C.E., Capabilities in I nf rarecj Rapid Scan Spectroscopy, RDTR No. 268, Naval Ammunition Depot, Crane, Indiana (May 1974).

Electroelastic, short-circuit, normal modes are computed by solving the simplified one-dimensional approximate equations of thin-shell theory, and the results are used to compute the admittance-matrix elements of an N-port representation of the shell. Once the admittance-matrix elements have been computed, the calculation of the open-circuit sensitivity follows from a straightforward application of N-port theory. Computations of the open-circuit sensitivity of capped, uniformly polarized and bipoled shells are made as a function of frequency. The result is that the bipoled shell has 6 dB greater sensitivity than does the uniformly poled shell. In addition, our calculations indicate the frequency range over which one can reasonably use classical, low-frequency results. The paper concludes with the calculation and discussion of electroelastic, open-circuit, normal modes of the uniformly poled shell. © 1977, Acoustical Society of America.

As an example of how to use finite elements, the short circuit and open circuit normal modes of a radially polarized piezoelectric cylindrical thin shell are obtained. The computational procedures are shown, with special emphasis on how the system matrix equations can be constructed as well as solved by the computer.

This difference exists because in their calculation GJM made use of measured electronic stopping powers (Se) for channeled ions. The scaling procedure employed by GJM builds into their calculation the pronounced Z1 oscillations observed in the S e of channeled ions. Use of the measured electronic stopping powers was limited to N, O, P, Cl, Ar, and the above mentioned ions in Si. In order to make an experimental check of the scaling procedure employed the range-energy curve for 19F in Si has been measured between 100 and 550 keV. The following observations can be made: (1) The experimental range-energy curve for 19F is in good agreement with LSS calculations and (2) the measured ranges are significantly less than the predictions of Gibbons, Johnson, and Mylroie. These results are interpreted as strong evidence against the validity of scaling Eisen's measurements of the electronic stopping power for channeled ions over to random trajectories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gibbons, J.F., Johnson, W.S., Mylroie, S.W., (1975) Projected Range Statistics Semiconductors and Related Materials, 2nd Ed., , (Dowden, Hutchinson and Ross, Inc., Stroudsburg, Penn.); Johnson, W.S., Gibbons, J.F., (1969) Projected Range Statistics in Semiconductors, , (Stanford U.P., Stanford); Eisen, F., (1965) Can.

Isolation of Schmitz products under alkaline (kinetic) conditions yields a mixture of 3a,b and a small amount of an epimer (3c) with endocyclic C-6 substituent and C-2, C-4 cis exocyclic substituent stereochemistry. The acid-catalyzed equilibration of 3a-c generally yields a ca. 1:1 mixture of 3a and 3b (12 examples with alkyl, phenyl, and benzyl substituents); the equilibration mechanism is discussed1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were employed in determination of product assay and stereochemistry. Oxidation of all equatorial 2,4,6-trialkyl-1,3,5-hexahydrotriazines (17) with tert-butyl hypochlorite in alkaline medium leads to a mixture of 3a (predominantly) and 3b,c; the reaction mechanism of this oxidation is discussed.

The kinetics of formation and decomposition of 2 have been studied by the stopped-flow method between pH 1 and 13. At pH &lt; 7, the formation of 2 appears to arise exclusively from the attack of a water molecule on the substrate 1, which is apparently the first report of this kind in the field of Meisenheimer complexes. At pH &gt; 7, the hydroxide-ion attack starts to compete with that of water; at pH &gt; 9 the reaction 1 + OH- → 2 is the only one observed. At pH &gt; 10.6, the oscilloscope pictures reveal the existence of a fast equilibrium between 2 and a new species 3, which is completely formed at pH 13 and identified as the dianion arising from the ionization of the hydroxyl group of the adduct 2. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters ΔH°, ΔS°, ΔH╪, and ΔS╪ for the various reactions have been determined. The formation and decomposition of 2 are subject to general base and general acid catalysis, respectively. Possible mechanisms for the reactions are discussed on the basis of the buffer catalysis effects and deuterium isotope effects. In particular, the abnormally high values obtained for the rate constants for base catalysis by carbonate and bicarbonate ions suggest a nucleophilic attack of these anions on 1 to give an unstable Meisenheimer-type intermediate. © 1976, American Chemical Society.

Concentration versus depth profiles were ob-tained by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) techniques. Pyrolytically deposited and sputter-coated Si02 and Si3N4 films were used as encapsulants for the 500 to 900° annealing study. Semi-insulating GaAs was implanted with 200 keV34S+ to fluences of 1 × 1014 and 52× 1014/cm2, and 100 keV9Be+ in the 1 × 1013 to 1 × 1015/cm2 fluence range. The S profiles did not change significantly after annealing at 800°C, although there was some skewing after annealing above 600°C. In contrast, the Be profiles showed significant changes and a decrease in the peak concentration for the ≥ 5 × 10T4/cm2 implants after a 700°C anneal. After a 800°C anneal the Be profile was essentially flat with a monotonic decrease from the surface into the implanted re-gion and a 900°C anneal caused a further decrease in the Be concentration. Profiles of Be implants of ≤ 1 × 1014/cm2 did not change significantly after annealing indicating that the higher fluence cases were related to solubility effects. © 1976 American institute of mining, metallurgical, and petroleum engineers, inc.",,"SEMICONDUCTING GALLIUM COMPOUNDS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Morabito, J.M., Lewis, R.K., (1973) Anal.

The rates of these reactions have been qualitatively determined and found to be dependent upon the R group in the order: 1-naphthyl &gt; C6H5 &gt; CH3 &gt;C2H5 &gt; i-C3H7 &gt; t-C4H9. They are also metal dependent with Cu(baen) reacting much faster than Ni(baen). The complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, melting points, and electronic and infrared spectra. The ligands have been displaced intact from the complexes with H2S in benzene or chloroform and characterized by elemental analyses, melting points, and infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. Sulfuric acid degradation of the complexes in methanol produces N-substituted acetoacetamides. These have been characterized by melting points, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry and in some cases by their 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives.

Properties of the lowest (“breathing”) mode of the shells are determined by using three-dimensional finite elements, and this knowledge is utilized in defining an N-port representation of the array. An N-port representation of the external fluid is obtained by solving the Helmholtz integral equation that relates fluid velocities and pressure on the exterior of the array. The two N-ports are coupled together in a standard circuit-theoretic manner to produce an equation for the electrical driving-point impedance of the loaded projector. Several frequency responses, which illustrate the effects of varying certain parameters are presented.

The approach is to solve an integral equation, in the Fourier transform domain, that relates the charge density on the fingers to the electric potential of the fingers. The solution of the integral equation is accomplished by expanding the charge distribution in a series of pulses and then transforming the problem to a vector-matrix one which is readily handled by a computer. in this manner the charge distribution is determined for a variety of conditions. © 1976 by the Acoustical Society of America",,"PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS; SURFACE PHENOMENA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Special Issue on Microwave Acoustics (1969) IEEE Trans.

Favorable constellations in a chromophore are discussed which are necessary to convert it into a potential laser dye; that is, an auxochromicgroup-substituted compound showing only small triplet-triplet (T-T) absorption over its fluorescence region. T-T laser photoselection spectroscopy is shown to be a valuable tool for obtaining polarization data on T-T absorption bands. The S-S absorption, fluorescence, and T-T absorption and polarization spectra of p-terphenyl, p-quaterphenyl, PPO, BBO, POPOP, and α-NPO were measured. T-T absorption and polarization spectra of some of these indicates that an improvement in laser action should occur when they are para-substituted by auxochromes. p.p′-Diamino- and p,p′-N,N,N′,N′-tetraethyldiaminoterphenyl, p,p′-diamino- and p,p′-N,N,N′,N′-tetraethyldi-aminoquaterphenyl, and p,p′-dibutoxy-POPOP were synthesized. Their T-T absorption showed remarkably large red shifts; moreover, the bands for the aminooligopheny lenes were very broad. This indicates nonplanarity of higher triplet states. Out-of-plane molecular electronic states reduce quantum fluorescence yield. To improve laser performance, ways to render the molecule coplanar are presented. Commercially available laser dyes are classified according to their constellations, and some of their spectroscopic data are presented. It is concluded that dyes with far better laser action properties could be synthesized. Some suggestions are made as to which chromophores appear most promising for conversion into potential laser dyes. © 1974, American Chemical Society.

The reaction follows a first-order rate law and is apparently heterogeneous. An unusually large, negative value for the activation entropy and a relatively low activation energy is found for this reaction. Possible explanations for these results include the concepts that the solvated electron is involved in the decomposition reaction and that electron transfer occurs by a tunneling mechanism. © 1974, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Evidence is found for the ambidentate behavior of the tetrazoles, wherein coordination of either the N1or N2nitrogen is observed. The complexes have been studied in solution by proton and fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance, electronic and infrared spectroscopy, and conductometric methods. The ambidentate behavior of tetrazoles and the effects of solvent, phosphine, and the nature of the anion on the solution behavior and on the isomerization mechanisms were ascertained. When the isomerizations are catalyzed by phosphines, tetrazole exchange is more rapid than phosphine exchange, whereas in the absence of excess phosphine, phosphine exchange is more rapid than tetrazole exchange. Equilibrium and activation thermodynamics were determined and profile diagrams were constructed for these processes. A unified mechanism for isomerization of square-planar complexes is developed and discussed in terms of orbital symmetry selection rules. © 1974, American Chemical Society.

The measurements are discussed in terms of the theories of Kolodziejczak, Lax, and Nishina (KLN) and Boswarva, Howard, and Lidiard (BHL). Interpretation of the measurements according to these theories indicates that the major contribution to the Faraday rotation in this region is from direct transitions, and only a small contribution from indirect transitions is present. From the theory of KLN, a direct energy gap of 3.07 eV and an indirect energy gap of 1.18 eV were obtained. From the theory of BHL, a direct energy gap of 2.80 eV and an indirect energy gap of 1.16 eV were obtained.

These nearest-neighbor selection rules (NSR) are different from and supplementary to the usual group-theoretical selection rules. NSR for wave vectors at X or L are expressed in Born's (NSRB) and in Keating's (NSRK) formalism. The NSRB refer to anharmonic two-particle interactions; the NSRK allow interactions between two or more particles. The applicability of the NSR to various multiple-phonon processes-with emphasis on infrared two-phonon absorption-is investigated and the results of some relevant model calculations are given.

There are three reasons for introducing such a coordinate system rather than making the usual assumption that when a spherical or cylindrical explosive charge is initiated simultaneously on its curved surface the detonation front maintains its symmetry as the detonation converges to the center: (1) Calculations made elsewhere show that a converging circular shock wave is unstable. (2) Calculations in this paper show that if spherical or cylindrical symmetry is maintained, density, and velocity become infinite, but if the detonation front folds these quantities remain finite except at a few points which can be removed by cuts. The average fluid velocity remains almost constant over 99% of the detonation front.
